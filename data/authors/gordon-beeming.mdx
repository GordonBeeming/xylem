Hi, I'm Gordon Beeming! I'm a Solution Architect at SSW in Brisbane, and I'm passionate about solving complex problems with clean, effective technology.

For me, DevOps is more than just a set of toolsâ€”it's a mindset that revolutionizes how we approach software development. I've been working within the Microsoft ecosystem since .NET 2.0 and have been a champion for Azure DevOps since its early days as TFPreview. My dedication to the community and technology has been recognized with the Microsoft MVP award every year since 2014.

I've had the incredible opportunity to share my knowledge by co-authoring several books and contributing to ALM Ranger guidance documents. Today, you'll find me designing and building solutions in Azure, helping teams write better C#, and sharing my discoveries on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gordonbeeming).

Outside of tech, I'm a husband and father who loves to unwind by training for my next swim, bike, or run event.

Let's connect and build something awesome together! ðŸš€
