So this is my first post in my new blog which I should be using for quite a bit longer than I Currently have been using my previous blogs on [WordPress](http://wordpress.com). I am using a base that was started by [Mads Kristensen](http://twitter.com/mkristensen) on [GitHub](http://github.com) called [MiniBlog](http://github.com/madskristensen/MiniBlog). I am trying where possible or requested pushing some changes back into the project so that others can also get extra functionality.
 
I am basically going to be building up this site as I go so at times it could look like a construction site but should always be fully functional and up and running.
 
For all my old post you can visit my old site which is [http://gbeeming.wordpress.com](http://gbeeming.wordpress.com), I will probably migrate some of those posts across but most of them will never be moved here.
 
Sit tight and look forward to reading many posts [here](https://beeming.net/).
