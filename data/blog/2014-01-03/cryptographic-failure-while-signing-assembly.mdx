Today I got a weird error on code that should just work.
 
Cryptographic failure while signing assembly '&lt;Debug Assembly Full Path&gt;' -- 'Error signing assembly -- Unknown error (8013141c)'    &lt;Solution Full Path&gt;\CSC
 
The reason why I say this was weird was because it was working before I rebooted my machine. So it was obvious from reading this error that the signing of the assembly was causing the projects build to fail. 
 
So first thing I did was open the project properties, go to the *Signing* Tab and uncheck the *Sign the assembly* checkbox.

This fixed my issue, but felt wrong and I knew it would bite me later. I thought a bit more about what was different before I rebooted and now and eventually remembered that before I rebooted I was running [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) in Administrator mode before. 
 
So I re-checked the *Sign the assembly* checkbox closed Visual Studio and then opened the project again with a new instance of Visual Studio that was running in Administrator mode

Rebuilt the solution and everything built as expected
