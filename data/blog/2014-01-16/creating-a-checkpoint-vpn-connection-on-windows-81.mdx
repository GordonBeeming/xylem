So we use [CheckPoint VPN](http://www.checkpoint.com/resources/virtual-private-network/), but the most frustrating part is that when a new version on windows is released the CheckPoint VPN client is incompatible with it and makes your computer weird when you do try use it.
 
For a while now I (and others) have been waiting for a client for windows 8.1. Very recently I found out that this functionality is baked into Windows 8.1 already and we don't have to wait 🙂. Here's how to create the VPN connection
 
Open the Charms bar (slide from the right or Win + C) and click Settings

Select Change PC Settings

Choose Check Point VPN as the provider, enter a name for the connection and also enter the server name or address and click Save
