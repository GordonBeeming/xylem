This post was originally found on my old blog at [http://gbeeming.wordpress.com/2013/06/28/tf400324-team-foundation-services-are-not-available-from-server/](http://gbeeming.wordpress.com/2013/06/28/tf400324-team-foundation-services-are-not-available-from-server/ "http://gbeeming.wordpress.com/2013/06/28/tf400324-team-foundation-services-are-not-available-from-server/").
 
## Full Error
 
TF400324: Team Foundation services are not available from server &lt;Server/CollectionName&gt;. Technical information (for administrator):   Page not found.
 
## Problem
 
This error could occur if you have moved a collection from one server to another and a client application connects to both servers. In my case this is because I’m running TFS 2012 on one server for production use and have backed up and restored a collection to a newly installed TFS 2013 Preview so that I can configure the process template ([Upgrading to Visual Studio Scrum 3.0 process template in TFS](http://nakedalm.com/upgrading-to-visual-studio-scrum-3-0-process-template-in-tfs-2013/) 2013) to take advantage of the new features in 2013 and test that before moving/upgrading the production server.
 
## Quick Fix
 
As a quick fix you can 

1. Close Visual Studio and related apps
2. Browse to *%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Team Foundation\5.0\Cache* and delete all the contents of that folder

This isn’t ideal as you will need to do this for each client and every time you switch between the 2. 

## Better Fix
 
As a better and more user friendly fix, you can

1. Do the Quick Fix
2. TS to the server where you have The new TFS server with a copy of your collection attached (my TFS 2013 instance)
3. Open a command line window in Administrator mode
4. Run cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 12.0\Tools"
5. Run tfsconfig ChangeServerID /sqlinstance:&lt;Your Sql Instance Name&gt; /databasename:&lt;Your configuration Database Name&gt; /ProjectCollectionsOnly
6. This should bring up a message that says "The command ChangeServerId should only be run against a set of Team Foundation Server databases that have no application tiers configured. Do you want to continue with this operation? (Yes/No)"
7. Type Yes and hit enter

Now you should be fine to use both instances of TFS with the same collection name without issues
