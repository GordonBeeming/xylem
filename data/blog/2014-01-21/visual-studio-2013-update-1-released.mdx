[Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) 2013 Update 1 has been released and as usual you are able to use the /layout argument to download all the files so you can share them locally instead of everyone downloading them. As mentioned in [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/)'s blog [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/01/20/vs-2013-1-update-1-is-available.aspx) there is no update for TFS this time round but good things are coming for TFS Update 2.

Download the update file from [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41650](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41650 "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41650"). Hold down Shift and Right Click in the folder where you downloaded the file to and click on **Open command window here**.
