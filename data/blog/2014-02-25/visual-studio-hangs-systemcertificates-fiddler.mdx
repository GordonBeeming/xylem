For the last while I have been experiencing weird hangs with [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) 2013. To try identify what was causing the hangs or at least where about the problem was I ran [ProcMon.exe](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx) on devenv.exe and the point where Visual Studio hung I was getting the below output recursively

This was kind of weird because I'd never seen this before, I logged a [Microsoft connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/) case through Visual Studio's Report a Bug Feature after installing the [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Feedback Tool](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/563d1003-f0ed-498f-8ef9-f8ee1aac39fe) which allows a more detailed collection of data for your bug.

After creating this bug I attached a ETL trace using [PerfView](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28567), if you don't know how to use PerfView you can follow the tutorials on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) ([PerfView Tutorial](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/PerfView-Tutorial)).
 
The ETL Trace showed a large amount of time spent on the Certificates which matched what I found with ProcMon.exe

At this point it was pointed out that I should look at how many certs were in my SystemCertificates (C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\My\Certificates), I found that I had 2405 certs which was a lot more than usual

At this point we still didn't know what was causing so many certs to be generated. I decided to delete all the certs and see what happens. After a reboot everything was working 100% again ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)
 
Later I was playing with Fiddler and saw a weird error talking about certificates, I went to the certs folder and saw that there was more there. I deleted them again, went to a https site and saw certs been generated ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg), the reason for so many certs is because I had Decrypt HTTPS traffic option checked

Changed this to not have it checked (because I didn't need it) and now I have a low amount of certs in my System Certificates folder again ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg).
 
Hope this helps someone else with this random issue ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg)
