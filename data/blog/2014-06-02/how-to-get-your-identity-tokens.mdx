I’ve always found that it’s slightly harder than it needs to be to get the keys for apps to authenticate against Twitter, Facebook, Google and Microsoft Account. Today I’ll show you where to go to get all these keys.
 
## Microsoft Account
 
Go to the [Windows Live application management site](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) and sign in if you aren’t already. Click on *create application*, when the new page loads type an application name, select a language and click *I accept*. If your app is a web application enter the redirect domain otherwise select *Yes* under the mobile client app and then click *Save*.  

At this point you should see a message on the top of the form that reads *Your changes were saved*. You can now use the Client ID and Client Secret that are displayed on screen.  

## Facebook
 
Go to the [Facebook developers apps page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and sign in if you aren’t already, click on *+ Create new App* and enter an application name into the popup, optionally enter an application namespace and then select a category and optionally a sub category and the press *continue*. Enter the Captcha that is displayed and click continue.  

At the top of the page you will see your App ID and App Secret, customize all the settings of your app as you feel needed and then take the app out of Sandbox mode to make it live.  

## Twitter
 
Go to [Twitter Dev Site](https://dev.twitter.com/) and sign in if you aren’t already. Hover over your profile in the top right corner and then click on *My applications*.

Click on *Create a new application*. Enter a name, description and web address for your application, check the *Yes, I agree* checkbox, enter the Captha and then click on *Create your Twitter application*.  

If you scroll down a bit you’ll see your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.  

## Google
 
Go to [Google+ Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/), all instructions are under *Step 1: Create a client ID and client secret*, but I will place them here as well ![Smile](http://gbeeming.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/wlemoticon-smile1.png?w=800).  

Go to [Google APIs Console](https://developers.google.com/console), select create from the drop down menu on the left and then enter a project and click *Create Project*. In the all services list switch the *Google+ API* on and then when the page is redirect check *I agree to these terms* and click *Agree*.  

Next go to the APIs & auth tab, then the Credentials tab on the left and click on *Create new Client ID under the OAuth section*

Enter your product name and click *Next*. Select the application type that is applicable to you and then click *Create client ID*.  

After the popup closes you will see your Client ID and Client secret on the page.  

## Redirect Urls
 
You might be required to set the Redirect for your app in which case you can use the urls below for the different OAuth providers.

| **Provider** | **Url** |
| --- | --- |
| Google | [http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-google](http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-google) |
| Facebook | [http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-facebook](http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-facebook) |
| Twitter | [http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-twitter](http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-twitter) |
| Microsoft Account | [http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-microsoft](http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-microsoft "http://&lt;your_domain&gt;/signin-microsoft") |
