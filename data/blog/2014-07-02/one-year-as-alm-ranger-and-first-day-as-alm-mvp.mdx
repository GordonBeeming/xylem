So a year ago today [I joined](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2013/07/04/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-gordon-beeming.aspx) the [ALM Rangers](http://aka.ms/vsarUnderstand) family and have recently been "promoted" into an active ALM Ranger and worked on projects like [Upgrade Guide](http://aka.ms/treasure8), [Version Control (ex Branching and Merging) Guide](http://aka.ms/treasure18) and [Flight Plan](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2014/05/08/alm-community-shipped-the-flight-plan-a-simple-known-and-informative-view.aspx). 
 
Today I received my email informing me that [I have been awarded](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Gordon%20Beeming-5000879) the Microsoft ALM [MVP Award](http://mvp.microsoft.com/) for 2014.
