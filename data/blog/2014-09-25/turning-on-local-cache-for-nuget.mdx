My internet connection is slow or down quite a lot. One of the things [Robert MacLean](https://twitter.com/i/discover) pointed out today in a presentation at a [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) Dev Day event today is that is that you can make use of the local cache from previous downloaded packages. Below is how to do this ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)
 
You can simple hit **ctrl + Q** type **NuGet** and then choose **Package Manager Settings**.

When the window opens click **Browse**.

This will open a Windows Explorer window with a path like below

Copy that path into your clipboard and go back to the Package Manager Settings window. Click on the **Package Sources** tab and then click on the new button

Give this new package source a name and paste the path into the Source textbox

Click OK and you sorted. Your pc will now use your local cache for packages as well ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)
