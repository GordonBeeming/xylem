So you shouldn't need to do this but in my case for some reason I needed to activate windows after performing and upgrade from Windows 8.1. 
 
In my case I tried activating Windows by clicking on Activate Online and that didn't work for me. I managed to activate Windows 10 by entering the product key for enterprise.

**Windows 10 Pro Key**: NKJFK-GPHP7-G8C3J-P6JXR-HQRJR
