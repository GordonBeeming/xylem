So yesterday I posted [Pushing a new project to Chocolatey](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/post/pushing-a-new-project-to-chocolatey) and I said I would create another post showing how to configure how the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) install runs and [this](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/post/configuring-a-chocolatey-install) is that post ![Smile with tongue out](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile-with-tongue-out.svg).
 
## ChocolateyInstall.ps1
 
The first (only really) step to do this is creating a ChocolateyInstall.ps1 script. From looking at other packages I saw that there was a file like this in a tools folder so I created one for myself in my [DotNet Pretty](https://github.com/Gordon-Beeming/DotNet-Pretty) project
 
<Figure key="/images/494f680f083a4812bf59128f5aecdfe1.png" src="/images/494f680f083a4812bf59128f5aecdfe1.png" alt="2014-10-28_08-18-26" width="0" height="0" caption="FILL THIS IN" />
 
and set the *Build Action* to Content and *Copy to Output Directory* to Copy Always

The contents of the script was as below
 
```powershell
[string]$ScriptDir = Split-Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path -Parent[string]$copyTo = "$([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath("mydocuments"))\Visual Studio 2013\Visualizers"[string]$mainAssemblyPath = "$ScriptDir\..\..\lib\net45\*.*"[string]$binDependenciesAssemblyPath = "$ScriptDir\..\binDependencies\*.*"if (!(Test-Path -LiteralPath $copyTo)){    New-Item -Path $copyTo -ItemType directory}Copy-Item -Path "$mainAssemblyPath" -Destination "$copyTo" -ForceCopy-Item -Path "$binDependenciesAssemblyPath" -Destination "$copyTo" -Force
```

Basically doing the exact same thing as what I was doing with the DEBUG post build event in the project settings

I checked that in (over a couple of commits because I didn't get it right the first time ![Smile with tongue out](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile-with-tongue-out.svg)). [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/) picked up the new commit and performed a build for me. Instead of waiting for my hourly push of packages to Chocolatey from MyGet I just pushed the package as I did in the previous post. I then ran the Chocolatey install for my package

```powershell
choco install dotnetpretty -pre
```

and then navigated to the Visualizers folder and my new assemblies were there ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)

If you have any feedback or a better way to perform this install do let me know ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg)
