## Inspiration 
 
Today my [DotNet Pretty](https://github.com/Gordon-Beeming/DotNet-Pretty) articles were featured on [@coding4fun](https://twitter.com/coding4fun) by [Greg Duncan](https://twitter.com/gduncan411) and one of the comments by [Niner bc3tech](http://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/bc3tech) ([@bc3tech](https://twitter.com/bc3tech)) requested that I share this solution on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). I decided that this was a good idea and decided to share my experience ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg).
 
## Creating a Chocolatey Account
 
Creating the Chocolatey account was as simple as filling a couple of common fields at [https://chocolatey.org/account/Register](https://chocolatey.org/account/Register "https://chocolatey.org/account/Register").

In the registration mail you are given a link to [Rules to be observed before publishing packages](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages#rules-to-be-observed-before-publishing-packages) which mentions that you can [host your packages with MyGet](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/Hosting-Chocolatey-Packages-on-MyGet)

## Creating a MyGet Account
 
Heading over to [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/) I saw that they had a Free subscription
 
[![2014-10-27_18-37-06](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/197a77ab8fc921a976f031488fa3aaba28bb3090/4010ec5d-3560-4925-896b-761bf75e41f1.png "2014-10-27_18-37-06")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/9ae41210ff066e02edb83d4d6494d221c1a5dde9/a8a9eaaa-b7a1-4140-b0ee-2ca5a7d883ae.png)
 
But they also have an offer for [MVP](http://mvp.microsoft.com)'s, ASPInsiders, Windows Azure Insiders and ALM Rangers ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg). Fitting into [2 of these categories](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/post/one-year-as-alm-ranger-and-first-day-as-alm-mvp) now I decided to head over to [https://www.myget.org/mvp](https://www.myget.org/mvp "https://www.myget.org/mvp") and request a NFR license ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg). The extra features available on this subscription made it perfect for my community project (and ones to follow ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)). In no time I had my [DotNet Pretty Package Feed](https://www.myget.org/F/dotnetpretty/) up.
 
## MyGet Build Services
 
The DotNet Pretty project is currently hosted out on [GitHub](http://github.com) and so I decided that I'll try out MyGet's build services which is now in preview. This was as simple as clicking on *BUILD SERVICES* from the menu and then on *Add build sources* and then *from GitHub*.
 
[![2014-10-27_18-47-01](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/f348622b7bb1105af186e9870cbe41cd07decfb7/b06572b9-ceb1-40d9-9d66-1cbed2fa1a80.png "2014-10-27_18-47-01")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/337311ba1d5b5f398ef7c86c7a8750c1637de602/6696cbbb-33dc-4507-92cf-4000dfa27131.png)
 
this poped open the *Link build source* dialog where I selected the DotNet Pretty project from the list and clicked *Add.*
 
[![2014-10-27_18-48-37](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/c62f584e1486e0585484e33b6d8e6d9dc76ed1dd/881e93e9-1203-48cd-8482-35cc9ef749b3.png "2014-10-27_18-48-37")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/4ed46f3518bbf5460a833b9ce416fbb4623b0d3c/78fda80f-3947-42af-903b-5c073ed98b08.png)
 
From here I clicked *Build* and in no time the build completed

## Updating GitHub project to show MyGet build status
 
From the build services page I was able to click on copy markdown
 
[![2014-10-27_18-58-09](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/26b6fdb030ab876b3772324589cf5cee28bdba88/7ff63bed-29b2-4193-bcc3-76bb8b5809b1.png "2014-10-27_18-58-09")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/05a492a718dc90ce02fe04f6cb384da9fd35dd6d/5411168b-663f-409e-8c07-d8d6ed5e078c.png)
 
which gave me the markdown that I could insert into the readme.md file which I did with my new favorite Markdown editor [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) 2

A [quick commit](https://github.com/Gordon-Beeming/DotNet-Pretty/commit/d572a38dccd8f83b015f39c61c6b77c28ea80c33) added this status to the public project on GitHub

## Pushing the packaged to Chocolatey 
 
The next thing I needed to do was add a new package source to my MyGet package feed Chocolatey. I went over to the *Package Sources* menu and clicked on *Add package source* and the *NuGet feed*.
 
[![2014-10-27_19-24-12](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/6f737cc115255cff5822407915bd5646df7bccc9/12c0eef9-51b7-4e96-ab7b-e88f84d72d17.png "2014-10-27_19-24-12")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/94e382b1bd6080ad345b3c1e1e84f2e92ccda3b6/1dee06e6-6456-48a7-aef9-5b796e59edf6.png)
 
The next bit was very simple, I simple clicked on *Presets* and then *Chocolatey*
 
[![2014-10-27_19-25-49](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/054688afb388454a9f0de0c0072fa52c912b0f1e/e89b59ac-b29f-4280-83e7-fd0ed7171d5e.png "2014-10-27_19-25-49")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/36eebf0830c83c8b3921a6417f7c01eb88a1ba9e/bc17690f-f9f1-4d9d-b283-43721dab43f2.png)
 
This then went ahead and filled in the Name and Source for me
 
[![2014-10-27_19-26-42](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/ec25b076c04adad79b4eaaa5508182c29c0bcdd4/30d99844-2b4a-4dcb-9d6e-6fa9461237b3.png "2014-10-27_19-26-42")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/ca75a7752507038e28fdb232faa26c97410da04a/b81db25f-bfc2-438e-ac8b-e183de75d259.png)
 
All that was left to do was provide my Chocolatey which was my Username, Password and API Key. I also filled in some of the extra meta data for my source
 
[![2014-10-27_19-29-39](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/9d2959a7d25feacf0250933af8fd3b05927795ea/af97f195-2216-40d6-8078-8ba1458f7b7a.png "2014-10-27_19-29-39")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/91350f4010a3f3286fda43639ff49eb2fa4e405d/b8b152d1-efe0-4fa9-b342-97bba7f8369f.png)
 
Next I headed over to build services again and clicked on *Push upstream*
 
[![2014-10-27_19-30-34](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/27c203ab7ca92040b2785fbfb60f030e2daf1979/c0a256a5-5f60-414a-ae6d-3cff9b663d9e.png "2014-10-27_19-30-34")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/84a3ca222ee95f1095bcf74e01c4535755846eb3/928bb036-d42f-439b-b595-6c3ad130baf5.png)
 
this presented a window like below

where I just clicked on *Push*

And received the message saying they on it ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg). Headed back over to Chocolatey and my package was in the list
 
[![2014-10-27_19-34-27](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/64557afc348c5696c4f4328f1d5663bf25372015/d81122d6-b91c-4105-9bcb-d6bdf0cd66a3.png "2014-10-27_19-34-27")](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/binaries/stream/image-jpg/image/1000/0/b13cae971434955542e0bcc5c11216965f06559a/fa39d377-5b2f-4622-b851-bdbe54a773d8.png)
 
## Installing Chocolatey "Client"
 
On the machine I'm using I didn't have Chocolatey installed so opened up a PowerShell Command Window as Administrator (just for in case ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)) and ran the command
 
iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

## Installing my package

To test if my package was installer I ran the command below

choco install DotNetPretty -Pre

which confirmed that my package now now been installed

At this point my Chocolatey package "installs" by dropping the package contents in the Chocolatey folder

In a later post I will share how to configure the installation logic for a Chocolatey script.
