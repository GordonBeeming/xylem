Sometimes you've got to dig into the database to solve application performance problems. In this LIDNUG webinar, Mitchel Sellers walks through performance tuning best practices, and investigates how developers can use ANTS Performance Profiler to explore their application code and the SQL queries and execution plans behind it. If you want to identify bottlenecks and other performance issues across your whole application stack, this is a good place to start.
