## Your VSO Account
 
Ok so obviously the first you need is to have a VSO account. If you have one already, awesome, continue on and skip this section. 
 
If not then you can get at [http://www.visualstudio.com/](http://www.visualstudio.com/ "http://www.visualstudio.com/"). All you need to do is click on *Sign up*, fill in all of one field for what you want your account name to be and then click *Create Account*.

In less than a minute (exactly 11 seconds when making this post) you will see the page to create your first VSO Project for this account.

When the dialog pops open you will need to click on the *Credentials* tab and then on *Enable alternate credentials*.
