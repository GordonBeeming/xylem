So leading off from the last post in the series where we just created a new VSO account we can click on our account in the list of accounts

and then we are taken to the Create your first team project page, enter a **Project name**, choose a **Process template** and what **Version control** you'd like to use and click **Create project**

Again it will go away and think for a bit, about 30 seconds late you will be redirected to you new Team Project

That's it, simple enough right.
