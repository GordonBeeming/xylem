This post is part of an overall [Series on Visual Studio Online](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/series/Visual-Studio-Online).
 
## Long Way
 
After you have a new Team Project in VSO you would eventually want to connect your Visual Studio to it. Open Visual Studio

Open Team Explorer by click **View** and then **Team Explorer**

When Team Explorer pops up click on the **Connect to Team Projects** button

and then click on **Select Team Projects**
 
<Figure key="/images/e887426f6819441f8d2e6528d249e175.png" src="/images/e887426f6819441f8d2e6528d249e175.png" alt="Team Explorer Connect page with Select Team Projects button highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Team Explorer Connect page with the Select Team Projects button." /> 
 
Click on **Servers**
 
<Figure key="/images/cb431513815e404b8c1efa33165f9af2.png" src="/images/cb431513815e404b8c1efa33165f9af2.png" alt="Connect to Team Foundation Server dialog with Servers button highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Connect to Team Foundation Server dialog: Servers button." /> 
        
Visual Studio conveniently loads a list of your servers connected to VSO for you if you signed in, if you don't see your newly created account in the list click **Add**
 
<Figure key="/images/eb30a6a5c24d4d72bc900aae07645277.png" src="/images/eb30a6a5c24d4d72bc900aae07645277.png" alt="Add Team Foundation Server dialog with Add button highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Add Team Foundation Server dialog: Add button." /> 
 
Enter the full url to your account as it was on your account page and click **OK**
 
<Figure key="/images/f3aee526c409496f89fc0b8be1240d92.png" src="/images/f3aee526c409496f89fc0b8be1240d92.png" alt="Add Team Foundation Server dialog with URL input field and OK button" width="0" height="0" caption="Adding a new Team Foundation Server by providing the URL." /> 
 
You account will now exists in the servers list, click Close and then the *Connect to Team Foundation Server* window will auto load your Team Project Collection and it's Team Projects, tick the checkbox next to the Team Projects you want to be able to connect from in Visual Studio and click **Connect**

Your Team Project is now connected to Visual Studio and you can now setup your builds, clone code repositories, etc

Slightly more steps than before.
 
## Short Way
 
Of course if you wanted to open the project the easy way you could simple navigate to the Team Project and click on **Open in Visual Studio**

this would then launch a new instance of [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and connects to your Team Project
