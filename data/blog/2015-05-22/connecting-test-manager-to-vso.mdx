This post is part of an overall [Series on Visual Studio Online](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/series/Visual-Studio-Online).
 
So for the developers we have connected [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) to [VSO](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs) but what about something for the QA guys. Well we all know that they spend a lot of time in [Microsoft Test Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj635157.aspx) so here's how you connect MTM to VSO. Open Microsoft Test Manager

MTM will open asking you to choose a Team Project, your Team Project Collection and Team Project should be in the list, if it's not then click **Add Server**

You will then be asked for the url, enter the full url that is shown on your account page and click **Add**

The Team Project Collection list will now refresh, select your Team Project Collection and Team Project that you want to connect to and click **Connect now**

Your MTM client is now connected to Visual Studio Online and you can now add/connect to Test Plans and then manage your testing "bits"
