When I first heard about the SDK for widgets in [Visual Studio Team Services](https://go.beeming.net/1JvoQC8) (VSTS) I wanted to make a couple of widgets, one of these was a [GitHub](https://go.beeming.net/1PnPzPb) widget that would show some info from any GitHub repo on your VSTS dashboard. This can can be helpful when you have your source open on GitHub but still work out of VSTS.
 
The implementation is very simple and you can see it and contribute on GitHub on one of my projects [VSTS.GitHubWidget](https://go.beeming.net/1JvvBUo).
 
## Install
 
Go to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) and head over to the **Integration** section and look for GitHub Widget

You can also follow this link for [GitHub Widget](https://go.beeming.net/1Jvqu6F). Now all you need to do is hit **Install**

Click **Continue**

and then click on Confirm to install the extension

and you will now have the extension installed in the account you selected.
