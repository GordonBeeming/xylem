I'm hoping it's not just me but one of the things I was missing from SSMS 2014 is that I had my line breaks when copying large text fields out of the query results. For a long time I have been putting it off and only using SSMS 2014, last week I re-installed my Operating System and decided not to install SSMS 2014 just for this 1 feature. 
 
Today I queried that 1 large value again where I needed line breaks and got a very long string (or varchar for you db people 🙂). I decided to go looking if they have made this into a setting before reverting back to SSMS 2014 like I have in the past and found there is actually a setting for this as you would expect 😁.  

## Retain CR/LF on copy or save
 
As mentioned there is a setting for this and it's not as hard to find as most other settings 🙂
 
### Option 1 – Navigate the menu's
 
Open *Tools, Options*

Navigate to *Query Results, SQL Server, Results to Grid*
 
<Figure key="/images/aef7b9f3166c4db0826f56a4321c1b20.png" src="/images/aef7b9f3166c4db0826f56a4321c1b20.png" alt="SSMS Options dialog showing Results to Grid settings" width="0" height="0" caption="SSMS Results to Grid Options" />
 
and on the right you will find a checkbox for *Retain CR/LF on copy or save*, switch that to checked and any future query windows will have you copying your text properly 🙂.
 
### Option 2 – Search
 
Open *Tools, Options*
 
<Figure key="/images/8b00c5db2a3b437da1779d270a53016b.png" src="/images/8b00c5db2a3b437da1779d270a53016b.png" alt="SSMS Tools menu with Options highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="SSMS Tools Menu" />
 
Type Grid in the search box

and on the right you will find a checkbox for *Retain CR/LF on copy or save*, switch that to checked and any future query windows will have you copying your text properly 🙂.

Hope this is useful for someone else as well. I find I usually fall back to what works instead of looking for the 'right' solution and if you look me that might be why you landed on this blog today 🙂.
