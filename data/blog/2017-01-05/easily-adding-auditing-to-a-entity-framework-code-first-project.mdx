If you've done any amount of development where you need to interact with data you'd know that at some point customers or stakeholders always want to know who made that change or when was that change made. To answer these questions you'd look to your auditing which in most cases is the last thing people think about adding into their apps for some reason.
 
This post will show you how to easily do auditing with entity framework projects. We'll also mention a little gotcha found and a sort of hack around fixing it.
 
## Setup
 
We going to do some setup first for anyone following along from scratch but feel free to skip to the implementation part to see the auditing specific bits.
 
### Project
 
First off we going to create a new ASP.NET Web Application
 
 and we'll choose the MVC template

 If we look in the **IdentityModels.cs** we'll see a **ApplicationDbContext** class that's we'll just add to for this sample
 
<Figure key="/images/8b34ea772f18433ebb589cc1fcc469a7.png" src="/images/8b34ea772f18433ebb589cc1fcc469a7.png" alt="ApplicationDbContext class in IdentityModels.cs" width="0" height="0" caption="ApplicationDbContext class within IdentityModels.cs" />
 
 Let's pull that out into it's own class file to make it easier to find 🙂
 
<Figure key="/images/072d65d55bbd4bb98b426631fca7fd4f.png" src="/images/072d65d55bbd4bb98b426631fca7fd4f.png" alt="ApplicationDbContext class moved to its own file" width="0" height="0" caption="ApplicationDbContext class in its own file" />
 
 Our project is ready to use now
 
 ### Scenario 
 
 We going to create a simple contact list that we'll scaffold. To do this we'll start by creating a new class in the Models folder called **Contact** and we'll add some basic properties to it
 
<Figure key="/images/0342e597b1654a2fb55669bb7baa1a6e.png" src="/images/0342e597b1654a2fb55669bb7baa1a6e.png" alt="Contact class with basic properties" width="0" height="0" caption="Contact class definition with properties" />
 
 Next Build your solution and then add a new **MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework** 
 
<Figure key="/images/e3bb92910c7a40ee88afdb288251881c.png" src="/images/e3bb92910c7a40ee88afdb288251881c.png" alt="Adding a new MVC 5 Controller with views" width="0" height="0" caption="Adding an MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework" />
 
 Next select the 
 
 - Contact class as the Model
 - ApplicationDbContext class as the Data context
 - Use async controller actions if not ticked
 - Default layout page if it's blank
 - Name of the controller as ContactsController

<Figure key="/images/42c0ebd6aeed4d8a81d0a3aa02110052.png" src="/images/42c0ebd6aeed4d8a81d0a3aa02110052.png" alt="Scaffolding options for ContactsController" width="0" height="0" caption="Configuring scaffolding for the ContactsController" />
 
 Your solution should be able to run, browse to /Contacts 
 
<Figure key="/images/94db8e86e733488a8e214dd8a5ac8430.png" src="/images/94db8e86e733488a8e214dd8a5ac8430.png" alt="Contacts list page in browser" width="0" height="0" caption="Browsing to the generated /Contacts page" />
 
 You will see all the CRUD that was generated for us and it should all work
