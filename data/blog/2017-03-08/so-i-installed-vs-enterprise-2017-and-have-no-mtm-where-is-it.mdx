If you've installed Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise and weren't one of the people that went over to the Individual Components tab to see what you weren't installing you probably don't have Microsoft Test Manager installed.
 
## What you need to do
 
Search for **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer** in your apps and run it
