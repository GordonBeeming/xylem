I see this message most times I format my machines after opening existing projects in Visual Studio and I always forgot how I solve it

You may think well that's simple right, install .net 4.7... the only problem then is you get this message which might be why you came to this post 🙂

The reason for this is that you need to install the Dev Pack for .net 4.7. In my case I already installed .net 4.7.1 and so just installed 4.7 didn't work for me.

Hope this helps someone else and also future me if you reading this you owe me a beer ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg).
