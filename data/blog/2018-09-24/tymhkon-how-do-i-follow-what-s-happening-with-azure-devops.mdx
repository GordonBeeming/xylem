[#TYMHKON](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/tags/tymhkon): [What is it?](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/vsts-tfs/2018/9/tymhkon-what-is-it)

So I thought I'd share a list of what channels I follow to take in the huge amount of information about [#AzureDevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/). 

## Twitter Accounts

From generally info I would recommend [@Azure](https://twitter.com/Azure), [@AzureDevOps](https://twitter.com/AzureDevOps)  and [@VisualStudio](https://twitter.com/VisualStudio).

Along with the *product* accounts you'd want to follow these individual accounts [@tfsbuck](https://twitter.com/tfsbuck) and [@DonovaBrown](https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown).

Also a great way to know organically who to follow and what's going on you should follow the rest of [League of Extraordinary Cloud DevOps Advocates](http://leagueofextraordinaryclouddevopsadvocates.com/) ([#LoECDA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoECDA)). [@abelsquidhead](https://twitter.com/abelsquidhead), [@damovisa](https://twitter.com/damovisa), [@stevenmurawski](https://twitter.com/stevenmurawski) and [@jldeen](https://twitter.com/jldeen).

There is a bunch of PMs that you should also follow, I haven't placed them here as the list would be very long, take a look at [who I follow](https://twitter.com/GordonBeeming/following) for more ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg). [@HosamKamel](https://twitter.com/HosamKamel) also made a list on Twitter that [shows all tweets](https://twitter.com/HosamKamel/lists/almrangers) from the DevOps Rangers

## Blogs

Blogs are a great way to get long reads that I'd recommend you add to [pocket](https://getpocket.com) and read when you have time to digest the information over some coffee ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg).

Microsoft DevOps Blog - [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/ "https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/") 

The Visual Studio Blog - [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ "https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/")

ALM | DevOps Rangers - [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalmrangers/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalmrangers/ "https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalmrangers/")

The Rangers also have blogs and a list of these can be found at [Follow the ALM | DevOps Ranger blogs and twitter feeds](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalmrangers/2018/09/06/follow-the-alm-devops-ranger-blogs-and-twitter-feeds/ "Follow the ALM | DevOps Ranger blogs and twitter feeds"). On the MS DevOps Blogs each week there is a session with a title like Top Stories from the Microsoft DevOps Community that contains info of what happened that week that might be of interest to you like last weeks [Top Stories from the Microsoft DevOps Community – 2018.09.14](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/09/14/top-stories-from-the-microsoft-devops-community-2018-09-14/).

## Podcasts

Listening to information is also a great way of taking in information, this is useful during your morning commute for example. These are below, you can follow their twitter accounts to know when there is new episodes or you can just add them to your podcast app

[@radiotfs](https://twitter.com/radiotfs), [@allthingsgit](https://twitter.com/allthingsgit) and [@devopsfm](https://twitter.com/devopsfm)

## Closing Off

Once you digest the flood of information from the above sources you can also look at who they follow, what I generally do is see who they retweet and then after I notice enough good content coming to me through retweets I look at that persons feed and see if the rest of their feed is relevant or if I should just enjoy the great retweets from my current list of people I follow to lower the noise.

Cheers and if you have other great sources add them to the comments below ![Open-mouthed smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/open-mouthed-smile.svg)
