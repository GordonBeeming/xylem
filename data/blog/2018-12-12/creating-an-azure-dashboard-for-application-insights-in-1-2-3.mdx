So watching this weeks asp.net community standup [ASP.NET Community Standup - December 11, 2018 - 2.2 Release Party!](https://go.beeming.net/2rz4JNy "ASP.NET Community Standup - December 11, 2018 - 2.2 Release Party!") and [Scott Hanselman](https://go.beeming.net/2zW28S9) shows how to make a dashboard for your application insights resource in no time.

## How do I make a dashboard for Application Insights?

Basically head over to the*<u> </u>****<u>(1)</u>***[Azure Portal](https://go.beeming.net/2SGDvjt) and ***<u>(2)</u>*** find your resource, I’ve opened up my blog

Once open click the ***<u>(3) </u>*Application Dashboard** button

What this will do for us is take all the important information from our resource and make a dashboard for us like below

The dashboard is also shared with other admins of the subscription

That was much quicker to make than the previous Blog dashboard that I made and has a lot more meaningful data on it ![Smile](https://gordonbeeming.com/images/emoticons/smile.svg)
