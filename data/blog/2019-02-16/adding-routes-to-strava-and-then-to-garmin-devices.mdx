I've spoken to a couple of people who want to add routes to their Garmin devices but the path isn't as straight forward as you'd imagine it should/can be.

## Exporting routes from mapometer

I do a lot of runs with a local group near us called “Beloved Long Runs” or BLR for short. The group has runs every Saturday and is a great place for runners who want to start pushing the mileage in a safer environment (there is a lot of people) where you are treated like an elite athlete with all the great tables that are setup by volunteers.

Anyway, back to the article 🙂. On the site is a [training calendar](https://www.belovedlongruns.co.za/calendar/month) that lists all the planned runs and has a link to (1) Google Map directions to the start as well as a (2) Route that will be run that day. I'm going to go ahead and click on View Route

<Figure key="/images/87c104c474b14c3785ba56f290c1b815.png" src="/images/87c104c474b14c3785ba56f290c1b815.png" alt="Beloved Long Runs calendar with 'View Route' highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Beloved Long Runs Calendar - View Route" />

This will then link off to [mapometer](https://za.mapometer.com/) where the routes are currently hosted. From here we are going to (1) open the actions slide and (2) click on Export

<Figure key="/images/f8883934d6ed47dab51318e2ddff0a24.png" src="/images/f8883934d6ed47dab51318e2ddff0a24.png" alt="Mapometer interface with 'Actions' and 'Export' highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Mapometer - Export Route" />

You'll then be asked for some settings, the defaults normally work great for me, go ahead and click on Export File

<Figure key="/images/def5667561ee4634a6367a0a3901e618.png" src="/images/def5667561ee4634a6367a0a3901e618.png" alt="Mapometer export settings dialog" width="0" height="0" caption="Mapometer - Export Settings" />

Save that file somewhere on your computer and then let's move onto the next section

## Uploading gpx files to Strava

It's not part of Strava's main app but if you google [Strava Labs](https://labs.strava.com/) or go directly to [https://labs.strava.com/](https://labs.strava.com/ "https://labs.strava.com/") you'll see a site like below showing off some of their R&D projects. If you click on Projects to see the full list of projects

<Figure key="/images/c21dc726527944f9a33c80eab9d58def.png" src="/images/c21dc726527944f9a33c80eab9d58def.png" alt="Strava Labs homepage" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava Labs Homepage" />

and then you should in that list see a project Called GPX to Editable Route, click on that project

<Figure key="/images/93a1e64c70624f3cad330a3c46edf2fe.png" src="/images/93a1e64c70624f3cad330a3c46edf2fe.png" alt="Strava Labs projects list with 'GPX to Editable Route' highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava Labs - GPX to Editable Route Project" />

Once the project page opens you can can click on Upload GPX File and upload the file you have saved on your computer

<Figure key="/images/5ef032627bd64c58a19da1eb1ffa35d7.png" src="/images/5ef032627bd64c58a19da1eb1ffa35d7.png" alt="Strava Labs GPX to Editable Route uploader" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava Labs - Upload GPX File" />

This will then upload that file and analyze it to pull all the points out, once done it will see your route on the map and you can click Save and Edit

<Figure key="/images/17ddc0a1c1f34db4aab92b56dc270455.png" src="/images/17ddc0a1c1f34db4aab92b56dc270455.png" alt="Strava Labs route preview with 'Save and Edit' button" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava Labs - Save and Edit Route" />

After that click you'll be redirected back to what should look like a familiar screen and is the regular Strava route editor. (1) Make sure Run is selected (if this is a run), then (2) click on Save

<Figure key="/images/c1b92ff9a8914df2bb9bb8f1633c83d3.png" src="/images/c1b92ff9a8914df2bb9bb8f1633c83d3.png" alt="Strava route editor with 'Run' selected and 'Save' button highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava Route Editor - Save Route" />

You'll then be asked for the (1) name for your route and you can then (2) click Save

<Figure key="/images/6ddebfb194894c8499b0c18484cbe5ca.png" src="/images/6ddebfb194894c8499b0c18484cbe5ca.png" alt="Strava save route dialog with name input and 'Save' button" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava - Name and Save Route" />

Your route is now added to Strava, go ahead and click on View My Route because we need to favorite it in Strava

<Figure key="/images/e659e3ba34704387809b098965335dc6.png" src="/images/e659e3ba34704387809b098965335dc6.png" alt="Strava route saved confirmation with 'View My Route' button" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava - Route Saved Confirmation" />

Go ahead and click the star to favorite the route in Strava

<Figure key="/images/3512f7c6ee8145d1b97ac70a027457bf.png" src="/images/3512f7c6ee8145d1b97ac70a027457bf.png" alt="Strava route page with favorite star highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Strava - Favorite Route" />

Once a route is favorited in Strava we can move on and get that onto our device

## Installing Strava Routes on your Garmin device

Go to the Connect IQ Store and search for and install the Strava Routes application. The Connect IQ Store will tell you that the app will appear on your device after the next sync and you'll see the app in your Activities & Applications

<Figure key="/images/909730e74ec8416e87cb9855a4d6a1a3.jpg" src="/images/909730e74ec8416e87cb9855a4d6a1a3.jpg" alt="Garmin Connect IQ Store showing Strava Routes app" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Connect IQ - Strava Routes App" /><Figure key="/images/222de520cab74f5199c964454dbb2dc4.jpg" src="/images/222de520cab74f5199c964454dbb2dc4.jpg" alt="Garmin Connect app showing Strava Routes in activities list" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Connect - Strava Routes in Activities" /><Figure key="/images/67c7130df2694ee6bef9c2888fabd306.jpg" src="/images/67c7130df2694ee6bef9c2888fabd306.jpg" alt="Garmin device showing Strava Routes app icon" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Strava Routes App Icon" />

You now need to sync your device with Garmin and we can then move on

## Navigating a Strava route on your Garmin device

Once you've done the sync you can head to start a new activity, scroll down to Strava Routes, click the start button

<Figure key="/images/84ed5d69b3314c8f990a1edb159e8e0d.png" src="/images/84ed5d69b3314c8f990a1edb159e8e0d.png" alt="Garmin device activity list with Strava Routes highlighted" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Start Strava Routes" />

You'll then be asked in the app to look at your phone and then sign in to Strava

<Figure key="/images/b78d5d8b384b4b299e8684ae325aea82.jpg" src="/images/b78d5d8b384b4b299e8684ae325aea82.jpg" alt="Garmin Connect app prompting to sign into Strava" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Connect - Sign in to Strava Prompt" /><Figure key="/images/4a440dc752dc42f29f3c44849ff46d5c.jpg" src="/images/4a440dc752dc42f29f3c44849ff46d5c.jpg" alt="Strava login page in Garmin Connect app" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Connect - Strava Login" /><Figure key="/images/38cf4ffa28774a1fb728a3fb31b8e972.jpg" src="/images/38cf4ffa28774a1fb728a3fb31b8e972.jpg" alt="Strava authorization page in Garmin Connect app" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Connect - Authorize Strava" />

At the end of the process you'll be told you can check your watch again. (1) You should see your route in the list because you have favorited the route, click Start. (2) some more details will come up for the route, now click start again to navigate the route. (3) You'll be asked which activity type you want to navigate the route for, go ahead and click Start on that activity type. (4) You'll see your activity start up and your route will be showing, if you are not near the start you'll see some navigation as with normal routes to where the route is.

<Figure key="/images/1c55b32d3d5f46f4a96a01e4cc29717a.png" src="/images/1c55b32d3d5f46f4a96a01e4cc29717a.png" alt="Garmin device showing list of Strava routes" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Strava Routes List" /><Figure key="/images/4e3a41128e86491181b21dae141b45d9.png" src="/images/4e3a41128e86491181b21dae141b45d9.png" alt="Garmin device showing route details" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Route Details" /><Figure key="/images/e6a13f633cbe434486abf1979b552ede.png" src="/images/e6a13f633cbe434486abf1979b552ede.png" alt="Garmin device prompting for activity type" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Select Activity Type" /><Figure key="/images/856e24e7d1e34671b1d30b9ce2fcac1c.png" src="/images/856e24e7d1e34671b1d30b9ce2fcac1c.png" alt="Garmin device navigating a route" width="0" height="0" caption="Garmin Device - Navigating Route" />

Another note is that once you have put the route into an activity, so basically the point we are at in the images above, that route can be easily navigated again just by going to your activity and scrolling down to navigation and then Courses and you'll see the route in the list to run again.
