Did you know that you can get a list of all organizations linked to your Azure Active Directory tenant? Since august this has been possible 😁.

I didn't know this was possible and thought that maybe a request through the support channels would allow me to get access to this information. [Sprint 157](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/2019/sprint-157-update) released this functionality for us

I somehow missed this in the release notes but is a small but really helpful feature, you can get to it by 

1. Clicking on Orgaization settings from your organization home page
2. Click on Azure Active Directory
3. Download

This will then download a csv file for you that will give you all the information you need to know which organization accounts exist and who the owner of those accounts are as well

Hopefully I'm highlighting a feature that you also didn't know about 😊.
