## YouTube Video

In this video we'll take a look at Managing GitHub secrets using terraform as well as federated identities from GitHub into Azure.

You should only be storing secrets if you absolutely need to, in this demo although we are only accessing storage accounts the change from a storage connection string to Azure Federated Identity means that we can access any of resource the identity has access too using RBAC which is a much better overall approach.
