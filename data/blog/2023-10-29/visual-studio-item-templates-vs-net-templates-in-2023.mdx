summary: 'Long ago, one of the ways we''d get some reuse out of standard and utility files would be by exporting item templates. Since the .NET CLI rolled around, the approach has been different and much easier. '

## Exporting Item Templates in Visual Studio

Let's start by looking at what the process looked like to export an Item Project template in Visual Studio.

Next, a dialog will come up asking you some info like which file you want to export, which references are essential for the item to work as expected, and some metadata for the item template

⚠️ WARNING: Make sure you backup this file to use on other machines or share it with your friends

Reusing this file is simple. All you need to do is copy the file into the My Exported Templates folder (you will need to create this folder if it does not exist) on another computer.

### Pros and Cons

Let's look at the pros and cons of exporting item templates in Visual Studio

✅ Quick and easy  
✅ Private by default  
✅ Item Templates show in the Visual Studio Project | New Item dialog  
❌ Only one file per item template  
❌ Manually backed up and shared  
❌ Updates require more manual effort  
⚠️ Requires restarting Visual Studio to use

So, let's look at the modern alternative to using Item Templates

## Creating config for a dotnet new template

So, this approach takes a little more effort but has many benefits over creating an item template.

### How does it work

dotnet new templates are installed from nuget package feeds. This could be the default public feed [https://www.nuget.org/](https://www.nuget.org/), which is typical for community/open source templates and is where the `dotnet new install` command will look for packages if not informed to look elsewhere using the `--add-source` argument. This post will create a package for the public feed and will be available to anyone who tries to install it

### Creating the nuget package

There are a couple of files that we'll need to create in a folder. I've published this sample to [GordonBeeming/DefaultCSharpRepoFiles](https://github.com/GordonBeeming/DefaultCSharpRepoFiles) on GitHub if you want to browse the source. We start with the following structure.

`root`  
`└───.template.config`  
`    └───template.json`  
`    └───icon.png`  
`└───DefaultCSharpRepoFiles.nuspec`  
`└───README.md`

**Figure: DefaultCSharpRepoFiles.nuspec - This file contains all the files that will be placed on the page that is published to nuget.org**


```markdown
# Default C# Repository Files

A couple of files that I generally add to each repository I create containing C# code

## Installing the template

To install the template, run the following command:

```bash 
dotnet new install GordonBeeming.DefaultFiles.CSharp
```

You'll see an update similar to this 

```bash
Template Name                Short Name          Language  Tags
---------------------------  ------------------  --------  ----------------------------
Default C# Repository Files  gb-defaults-csharp  [C#]      .NET/CSharp/git/editorconfig
```

## Using the template

Once installed, you can easily use the files by using the following command:

```bash
dotnet new gb-defaults-csharp
```

If you have any of the files already, you'll need to run the command with a `--force` argument.

## Checking for template updates only

If you already have the template installed you can run the following command to see if there is an update available

```bash
dotnet new update --check-only
```

To update all templates, remove the `--check-only` argument, to update this template only, run the install command again.

## Updating files to be included in the template

Updating files is simple... just add them and they should be published as `DefaultCSharpRepoFiles.nuspec` includes all files off the repository root.
```


**Figure: README.md - This file contains information that is shown on the repository on GitHub and the package page on nuget.org**


```bat
nuget pack DefaultCSharpRepoFiles.nuspec -NoDefaultExcludes -version 0.0.0.3
```


I won't dive into all the configurations inside all the files. You can read up on all the config and the process in more detail at [Create an item template for dotnet new - .NET CLI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/cli-templates-create-item-template). 

Once you have all these files, you can add any other files you want to include in the template once installed. I've included the following files for now in my template

`- .editorconfig`  
`- .gitattributes`  
`- .gitignore`

Run the below to pack the nuget package so it can be uploaded to nuget.org


and this will create a `nupkg` file (note you need a copy of nuget.exe globally to just pack directly like this)


<Figure key="/images/2023-10-30-01-59-44.jpg" src="/images/2023-10-30-01-59-44.jpg" alt="Once uploaded you will see all the information for the package, click Submit" width="0" height="0" caption="Once uploaded you will see all the information for the package, click Submit" />


<Figure key="/images/2023-10-30-02-04-28.jpg" src="/images/2023-10-30-02-04-28.jpg" alt="After clicking Submit, you will see that the page is uploaded with couple of warnings informing you that the page will take a bit to validate and index" width="0" height="0" caption="After clicking Submit, you will see that the page is uploaded with couple of warnings informing you that the page will take a bit to validate and index" />


Once the validation and indexing process is completed, you can install the template and use it using the commands below


```bat
dotnet new install GordonBeeming.DefaultFiles.CSharp
dotnet new gb-defaults-csharp
```


The `dotnet new install` command will install the latest template and update it if there is a newer version.

To check for updates without installing you can run


```bat
dotnet new update --check-only
```


If there are any updates, you will give get a response like the one below using `dotnet new update`, you can update all templates at once


```plaintext
An update for template packages is available:
Package                            Current  Latest 
---------------------------------  -------  -------
GordonBeeming.DefaultFiles.CSharp  0.0.0.3  0.0.0.4


To update the package use:
   dotnet new install <package>::<version>
   dotnet new install GordonBeeming.DefaultFiles.CSharp::0.0.0.4

To update all the packages use:
   dotnet new update
```


### Pros and Cons

Let's look at the pros and cons of creating a .NET template

✅ Easy to share with friends  
✅ Easy to version control changes  
✅ Easy to automatically package updates (check out next week's blog post for how we'd do this)  
✅ Flexibility - You can include any number of files in the template, from in and out of the solution  
❌ Public by default (not ideal for enterprises - maybe I'll add a post on changing this)  
❌ A more advanced approach, requiring a lot more work than creating an Item template

## Conclusion

The newer, preferred approach to creating item-type templates has changed significantly but has many advantages over the previous item-based templates. There is tons of documentation on how dotnet templates work and how you can customize them
