It's the call every developer dreads‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe deployment is failing.‚Äù

You check the logs, and sure enough, a workflow that has been running perfectly for months has suddenly decided to break. No code has changed on the `main` branch, no configuration *seems* to have been altered. Yet, here we are.

This is the story of one such mystery, a journey down a rabbit hole that starts with a scary-looking identity error and ends with a surprising culprit.

## The Scene of the Crime

The setup is modern and, until now, has been robust:
* A **GitHub Actions** workflow for CI/CD.
* **Passwordless deployments** to Azure using OpenID Connect (OIDC).
* A **PowerShell script** to run permission scripts on **Azure SQL** using `Invoke-Sqlcmd`.

Then, one afternoon, the pipeline glows red. üò±

## The Misleading First Clue

The first thing you see in the logs is this terrifying error message:

<Figure key="/images/2025-06-18-12-44-24.png" src="/images/2025-06-18-12-44-24.png" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub Actions log showing a PowerShell error message.

The error message is highlighted in red, indicating a failed deployment step. The overall tone is urgent and frustrating, reflecting a deployment failure in a technical environment." width="0" height="0" caption="The error that sends you looking in all the wrong places." />

Every instinct screams that this is an Azure AD problem. Did someone delete the Service Principal? Was the Federated Credential on the App Registration removed? Did a new Conditional Access policy just drop and ruin my day?

You go down the checklist:
* ‚úÖ App Registration exists.
* ‚úÖ Federated Credential looks fine.
* ‚úÖ Permissions haven't changed.
* ‚úÖ Entra admin says no new policies were applied.

Nothing makes sense.

## The Breakthrough

The big break in the case came from a simple observation: a deployment step *before* the failing PowerShell script was working perfectly. A Bicep deployment in the same job, using the same identity, was successfully deploying infrastructure to Azure.

This meant the failure was isolated to the PowerShell step. The GitHub Actions log looked conceptually like this:

```
##[group]Run Bicep Deployment
Run azure/arm-deploy@v1
...
Deployment Succeeded.
##[endgroup]
‚úÖ  Success - Bicep Deployment (2m 15s)

##[group]Run Permission Scripts
Run ./scripts/apply-permissions.ps1
...
Invoke-Sqlcmd: ManagedIdentityCredential authentication failed...
##[endgroup]
‚ùå  Failure - Permission Scripts (0m 12s)
```

This tells us something crucial:

1.  The fundamental authentication from GitHub to Azure **is working**.
2.  The Service Principal **is valid** and can get a token for the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API.

So, the problem isn't the identity itself, but something specific to the PowerShell script's attempt to connect to Azure SQL.

## The Real Culprit

After a lot of debugging, we proved that the Service Principal *could* get a token for Azure SQL using the `Get-AzAccessToken` cmdlet directly. The problem was that `Invoke-Sqlcmd`, when using `Authentication=Active Directory Default`, was failing to find and use that token correctly.

The real culprit was a subtle incompatibility or bug in the SQL driver being used by `Invoke-Sqlcmd` on the GitHub runner. It simply couldn't complete the passwordless authentication handshake on its own.

## The Solution

The solution is to stop relying on `Invoke-Sqlcmd`'s internal authentication mechanism and instead handle it ourselves. We get the token using the reliable `Get-AzAccessToken` cmdlet and then "spoon-feed" it directly to `Invoke-Sqlcmd`.

Here is the final, robust PowerShell class that implements this pattern, including token caching to make multiple calls more efficient.

```powershell
using module ./Logger.psm1 # Custom logging module

class SqlFunctions {

    $logger = [Logger]::new()

    [string] $serverName
    $sqlAccessToken # This will cache our token object

    SqlFunctions(
        [string]$serverName
            ){
        Set-PSRepository -Name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
        Install-Module -Name SqlServer -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false
        Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Repository PSGallery -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber
        $this.serverName = $serverName
    }

    [void] AddUserToRole(
                [string]$groupOrUserName,
                [string]$databaseName,
                [string]$roleName) {
        $this.logger.LogActivity("üîê Adding $($groupOrUserName) to $($roleName) for $($databaseName)...")
        $sqlCommand="IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = '$groupOrUserName')
        BEGIN
            CREATE USER [$groupOrUserName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
        END

        ALTER ROLE [$roleName] ADD MEMBER [$groupOrUserName];"

        try {
            # 1. Get the token (from cache or new)
            $accessToken = $this.GetSqlAccessToken()
            
            # 2. Pass it directly to the command and force errors to be caught
            Invoke-Sqlcmd -ServerInstance "$($this.serverName).database.windows.net" `
                    -Database $databaseName `
                    -Query $sqlCommand `
                    -AccessToken $accessToken.Token `
                    -ErrorAction Stop # Crucial for proper error handling!
            
            $this.logger.LogSuccess()
        }
        catch {
            $this.logger.LogError("Invoke-Sqlcmd failed. See the full error below.")
            Write-Error ($_.Exception | Format-List -Force | Out-String)
            exit 1
        }
    }

    [object] GetSqlAccessToken() {
        # 3. Check if we have a valid, non-expired token in our cache
        if ($this.sqlAccessToken -and (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime() -lt $this.sqlAccessToken.ExpiresOn.UtcDateTime.AddMinutes(-5)) {
            Write-Host "‚úÖ Using cached and valid Azure SQL token."
            return $this.sqlAccessToken
        }

        Write-Host "Attempting to retrieve Azure SQL access token..."
        $sqlResource = "https://database.windows.net/"
        try {
            $this.sqlAccessToken = Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl $sqlResource
            Write-Host "‚úÖ Successfully retrieved Azure SQL token."
            return $this.sqlAccessToken
        }
        catch {
            Write-Host "‚ùå FAILED: Could not get the Azure SQL token. Halting."
            Write-Error ($_.Exception | Format-List -Force | Out-String)
            exit 1
        }
    }
}
```

The key takeaways from the working code are:
1.  **Get the token manually** with `Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl "https://database.windows.net/"`.
2.  **Pass the token string** directly to `Invoke-Sqlcmd` via the `-AccessToken $token.Token` parameter.
3.  **Use `-ErrorAction Stop`** to ensure that if `Invoke-Sqlcmd` does fail, it generates an error that your `try/catch` block will actually see.

## Cheers

Sometimes the loudest error message is just a distraction. By digging deeper and isolating the problem, we found the issue wasn't with the identity, but with the tooling. Hopefully, this journey saves you from a few sleepless nights!
