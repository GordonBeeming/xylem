You've been there. You write some code, you write your tests, and everything comes up green. You deploy to production with confidence, only to be met with a cryptic runtime error that makes no sense.

This is the story of one such error—an `InvalidOperationException` from Entity Framework Core that seems to defy logic, especially when your tests say everything is fine.

## The Scenario: Cloning an Entity

Let's imagine a simple data model for a blog. We have a `BlogPost` entity, and each post can have a collection of simple `Tag` objects. Crucially, the `Tag`s don't have their own ID; they belong exclusively to a blog post and will be stored as a JSON column in the database.

Here are our entity classes:

```csharp
// The parent entity
public class BlogPost
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int Version { get; set; }

    // A collection of child objects with no independent identity
    private readonly List<Tag> _tags = new();
    public IReadOnlyList<Tag> Tags => _tags;

    // A method to create a new version of the post
    public BlogPost CreateNewVersion()
    {
        var newVersion = new BlogPost
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid(), // A new Id for the new version
            Title = this.Title,
            Version = this.Version + 1,
        };

        // This is the problematic line
        newVersion._tags.AddRange(this.Tags);

        return newVersion;
    }

    public void AddTag(string tagText)
    {
        _tags.Add(new Tag { Text = tagText });
    }
}

// The child object, stored as JSON
public class Tag
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

To configure this in EF Core, we use `OwnsMany` to define the relationship and `ToJson` to specify the storage mechanism.

```csharp
// In your DbContext's OnModelCreating or an IEntityTypeConfiguration<BlogPost>
public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<BlogPost> builder)
{
    builder.HasKey(b => b.Id);

    // This is the key line:
    // It tells EF Core that Tags are owned by BlogPost and stored as JSON.
    builder.OwnsMany(b => b.Tags, owned =>
    {
        owned.ToJson();
    });
}
```

The `CreateNewVersion` method seems simple enough. It creates a new `BlogPost`, gives it a new ID, and copies over the tags. What could go wrong?



## The Error and the "Why"

When you run this code in a live application, you might get this baffling error after trying to save the new version:

> InvalidOperationException: The property 'Tag.BlogPostId' is part of a key and so cannot be modified or marked as modified.

Your first reaction is likely, "What `BlogPostId`? My `Tag` class doesn't have that property\!"

And you're right, it doesn't. The error is referring to a **conceptual, in-memory shadow property** that EF Core creates because you used `OwnsMany`.

`OwnsMany` tells EF Core that `Tag` is an **owned entity**. It cannot exist without a `BlogPost`. To manage this, the EF Core Change Tracker creates an in-memory identity for each `Tag` instance that includes a link back to its parent (the conceptual `BlogPostId`).

Here's the chain of events in your live application:

1.  You load the original `BlogPost` from the database. EF Core begins **tracking** the `BlogPost` and all its child `Tag` object instances.
2.  You call `CreateNewVersion()`.
3.  The line `newVersion._tags.AddRange(this.Tags)` takes the **exact same C\# object instances** from the original post and adds them to the new version.
4.  You try to save the new `BlogPost`. The Change Tracker sees the `Tag` objects, recognizes them as the ones it's already tracking, and sees that you're trying to assign them to a new parent.
5.  This requires changing their conceptual `BlogPostId`, which is part of their identity. EF Core forbids changing a key property and throws the exception.

## But Why Do My Tests Pass?

The core issue is that the exact same code fails in the live application but passes in integration tests, despite the environments being configured to be identical. This indicates a subtle, underlying difference in the execution context.

### Investigated Factors

After troubleshooting, I confirmed the following variables were the same in both the test and live scenarios, ruling them out as the cause:

* **`DbContext` Lifetime:** The context was correctly scoped to the individual operation in both cases.
* **Initial Data State:** The entity being cloned was loaded from the database first in both environments.
* **Database Provider:** Both the test and live application used the same SQL Server provider.
* **Change Tracking Configuration:** The default `QueryTrackingBehavior` was identical.

## The Solution: Create New Instances

The fix is to stop reusing the old object instances and instead create new ones for the clone.

Update the `CreateNewVersion` method to project the old tags into new `Tag` objects.

```csharp
public BlogPost CreateNewVersion()
{
    var newVersion = new BlogPost
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
        Title = this.Title,
        Version = this.Version + 1,
    };

    // The Fix: Create NEW Tag instances instead of reusing the old ones
    var newTags = this.Tags.Select(t => new Tag { Text = t.Text });
    newVersion._tags.AddRange(newTags);

    return newVersion;
}
```

By using `.Select(t => new Tag { ... })`, you are creating brand new `Tag` objects. The Change Tracker has never seen these instances before, so it correctly treats them as new children of the new `BlogPost`, and everything saves perfectly.

The key takeaway? With EF Core, the **identity of your C\# object instances** is just as important as the data they hold.

## Conclusion

With all logical factors being equal, the discrepancy points to a deep, non-obvious difference between the test execution host and the live application web host.

The most important takeaway is that the original cloning logic was inherently fragile because its success depended on the state of the EF Core Change Tracker. The correct solution—creating **new instances** of the owned child entities—is robust precisely because it eliminates this dependency. It works correctly regardless of subtle environmental differences, making it the right approach for production code.
