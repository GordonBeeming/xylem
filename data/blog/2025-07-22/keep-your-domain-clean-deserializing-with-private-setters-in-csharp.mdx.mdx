---

As developers, we strive to build robust and well-designed domain models. A key part of that is **encapsulation**‚Äîprotecting the internal state of our objects and controlling how they are modified. A common way to achieve this is by using private setters on properties.

This works great until you need to serialize these objects to JSON and, more importantly, deserialize them back. You run your code and... `null`. The property with the private setter wasn't populated. ü§î

Do you have to make the setter `public` just to satisfy the serializer? Thankfully, no. Let's look at how to handle this gracefully with `System.Text.Json`.

## The Problem: A Phonebook Example

Imagine we have a simple `PhonebookEntry` class. We want the `Status` of an entry (e.g., "Active", "Inactive") to be controlled internally, so we give its property a `private set`.

Here's our initial domain object:

```csharp
// PhonebookEntry.cs
public class PhonebookEntry
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; private set; } // Private setter!

    public PhonebookEntry(Guid id, string name, string phoneNumber)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        PhoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        Status = "Active"; // Default status
    }
}
````

Now, let's try to serialize an instance of this class and then deserialize it back. This mimics a common scenario like saving state, sending it over an API, and then rehydrating the object.

```csharp
// Program.cs
using System;
using System.Text.Json;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var originalEntry = new PhonebookEntry(
            Guid.NewGuid(), 
            "Gordon Beeming", 
            "0400 123 456"
        );

        // Imagine we're manually setting the Status to something else for the payload
        var jsonPayload = $$"""
        {
            "Id": "{{originalEntry.Id}}",
            "Name": "{{originalEntry.Name}}",
            "PhoneNumber": "{{originalEntry.PhoneNumber}}",
            "Status": "Inactive"
        }
        """;

        Console.WriteLine("--- Original JSON Payload ---");
        Console.WriteLine(jsonPayload);
        
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Attempting to Deserialize ---");
        var deserializedEntry = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<PhonebookEntry>(jsonPayload);

        Console.WriteLine($"\nDeserialized Name: {deserializedEntry?.Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Deserialized Status: '{deserializedEntry?.Status}'"); // The issue will be here
    }
}
```

When we run this code, we'll see that the `Status` property fails to deserialize. It will retain the default value from the constructor because the serializer can't access the private setter.

This is a problem. We need our incoming data to be respected without breaking our object's encapsulation.

## The Simple Fix: Using `[JsonInclude]`

The fix is surprisingly simple and clean. `System.Text.Json` provides the **`[JsonInclude]`** attribute. By placing this attribute on a property, you're explicitly telling the serializer to include it during both serialization and deserialization, regardless of its accessibility.

Let's update our `PhonebookEntry` class:

```csharp
// PhonebookEntry.cs (Updated)
using System.Text.Json.Serialization; // Don't forget this using statement!

public class PhonebookEntry
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }

    [JsonInclude] // ‚ú® This is the magic!
    public string Status { get; private set; }

    // We need a parameterless constructor for the serializer to create an instance
    // before it can set the properties.
    public PhonebookEntry() { }

    public PhonebookEntry(Guid id, string name, string phoneNumber)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        PhoneNumber = phoneNumber;
        Status = "Active";
    }
}
```

**Note:** For `[JsonInclude]` to work on properties, the serializer needs a way to create an initial instance of the object. The easiest way is to provide a parameterless constructor.

Now, if we run the *exact same* `Program.cs` code as before, `System.Text.Json` will see the `[JsonInclude]` attribute and correctly populate the `Status` property using its private setter.

<Figure key="/images/GB-2025-07-22 at 13.30.20@2x.png" src="/images/GB-2025-07-22 at 13.30.20@2x.png" alt="Console output showing the deserialized status is now correctly 'Inactive'" width="800" height="0" caption="Success! The Status property is now correctly deserialized. ‚úÖ" />

## Advanced: Centralizing Logic with `[JsonConstructor]`

The constructor-based approach isn't limited to immutable objects. Its real power lies in **centralizing validation logic** to ensure an object is created in a valid state, even if it's mutable. This guarantees that no matter how an object is instantiated (by your code or by the serializer), it respects your core business rules from the very beginning.

To do this, you can use a **private constructor** for the creation and validation logic, and a **public static factory method** as the entry point for your application code.

```csharp
public class PhonebookEntry
{
  public Guid Id { get; } // ID can be immutable
  public string Name { get; set; } // Name can be changed
  public string PhoneNumber { get; set; } // Phone number can be changed
  public string Status { get; private set; } // Status is controlled internally

  // The single, private constructor with all validation logic.
  [JsonConstructor]
  private PhonebookEntry(Guid id, string name, string phoneNumber, string status)
  {
    // Central validation logic runs for all creation paths
    if (id == Guid.Empty) throw new ArgumentException("ID is required");
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name)) throw new ArgumentException("Name is required");
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(phoneNumber)) throw new ArgumentException("Phone number is required");
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(status)) throw new ArgumentException("Status is required");

    Id = id;
    Name = name;
    PhoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    Status = status;
  }

  // Public static factory method for creating a NEW entry from your application
  public static PhonebookEntry Create(string name, string phoneNumber)
  {
    // It calls the private constructor, ensuring the default "Active" status is used
    // and all validation is still run.
    return new PhonebookEntry(Guid.NewGuid(), name, phoneNumber, "Active");
  }

  // Public method to modify the object's state, enforcing rules
  public void Deactivate()
  {
    this.Status = "Inactive";
  }
}
```


## Which Approach Should You Use?

Choosing the right approach comes down to the complexity and rules of your object.

### Approach 1: `[JsonInclude]` with Private Setters

This approach is best for simpler objects or when validation is self-contained to a single property.

‚úÖ **Simple:** It's very easy to implement by adding an attribute.\
‚úÖ **Good for DTOs:** Works well for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) where complex business rules are not a concern.\
‚ùå **Decentralized Logic:** Validation logic can be spread across multiple setters, making it harder to ensure the object as a whole is valid.

### Approach 2: `[JsonConstructor]`

This is the superior approach for rich domain models where you need to enforce business rules that involve multiple properties.

‚úÖ **Guarantees Initial Validity:** The object is created in a transaction-like manner. It either succeeds with a valid state or fails. It can never exist in an invalid initial state.\
‚úÖ **Centralized Validation:** All rules for what makes an object valid are in one place, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\
‚úÖ **Clear Intent:** It clearly communicates the requirements for creating a valid object.\
‚úÖ **Enables Optional Immutability:** While it doesn't force immutability, it's the foundation for it. You can choose to make properties `get`-only if desired.\
‚ùå **More Boilerplate:** Requires a bit more initial setup (e.g., the static factory method).

For most scenarios involving rich domain models, the **constructor-based approach is the way to go**. It provides the strongest guarantees for creating valid objects and leads to more reliable, maintainable, and expressive code.
