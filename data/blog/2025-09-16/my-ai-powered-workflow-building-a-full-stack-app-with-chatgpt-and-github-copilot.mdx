I've always been fascinated by tools that can boost productivity, but the recent advancements in AI have felt like a completely different league. I wanted to see just how far I could push this new way of working.

So, I set myself a challenge: build a complete, full-stack URL shortener from scratch, but with a rule. I would write as little code as possible myself.

My role would be the **Architect**. My team? Two AI agents:
* **ChatGPT** as my Project Manager, responsible for planning.
* **GitHub Copilot** as my Developer, responsible for implementation.

Here's a breakdown of the workflow that followed.

## Step 1: The Blueprint from ChatGPT

Every good project starts with a plan. Instead of spending hours brainstorming user stories and technical tasks, I had a conversation with ChatGPT. I gave it a high-level brief for the application: a modern URL shortener with a React frontend, a Rust backend, and features like custom domains and passkey authentication.

I asked it to break this down into a detailed list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs).

The result was a comprehensive roadmap. I simply copied and pasted that plan directly into my repository, creating a GitHub Issue for each PBI. Just like that, my entire project backlog was planned out by my AI PM.

## Step 2: The AI Agent Development Loop

With the plan in place, it was time to build. This is where my role shifted from a hands-on coder to a director. For each feature, my workflow was the same:

1.  Open the GitHub Issue for the PBI.
2.  Assign it directly to the GitHub Copilot from the assignees section.

After some time, anywhere from a few minutes for simple tasks to nearly an hour for more complex ones, Copilot would automatically create a Pull Request with a full implementation of the feature. It handled the Rust backend, the React components, database logic... everything.

## Step 3: The Human in the Loop

Now, this wasn't a fire-and-forget process. This is where the real collaboration happened, and it's important to be honest about it: the workflow isn't perfect. I'd review the PR just like I would with a human team member and leave comments.

My feedback was a mix of refinement and, yes, sometimes bug fixes. While Copilot's code was often impressive, it wasn't always perfect. Seeing the feature come to life also sparked new ideas for improvements I hadn't thought of initially.

I'd leave comments like:
* "the test url button stopped working... please fix"
* "Don't leave TODOs... add this to the instructions too... fix it rather"
* "fetch configuration... no hardcoded urls"

Copilot would then go away, make the requested changes, and update the PR with new commits. This iterative loop was the core of the entire project.

## A New Way of Working

This workflow is a game-changer. By offloading the "how" to Copilot, I was free to focus entirely on the "what" and the "why." My time was spent on architecture, user experience, and the high-level direction of the project, not on writing boilerplate code.

For those who want to see the process firsthand, I've made the entire repository for the Thalora URL shortener public. You can dig into every PBI, see the PRs generated by Copilot, and read through all of my review comments. It's all out in the open\!

This is what I consider "Level 1" of AI-assisted development. It's an incredibly powerful way to accelerate a project. But what happens when you start running multiple AI agents in parallel? Well, that's a story for the next post. ðŸ˜‰
