summary: 'November 2025 is a massive release for copilot_here: Native ARM64 support for Apple Silicon, .NET 10 SDKs, PowerShell Core integration, plus the game-changing path mapping and flexible mount systems.'
---

November has been a busy month for [copilot_here](https://github.com/GordonBeeming/copilot_here). What started as a quality-of-life update for path mapping has evolved into a major platform expansion.

We now have native support for **Apple Silicon** and other ARM64 devices, **.NET 10** support, and a fully integrated **PowerShell** experience inside the container.

If you're new to copilot_here, check out my [previous posts](https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2025-10-03/taming-the-ai-my-paranoid-guide-to-running-copilot-cli-in-a-secure-docker-sandbox) about running GitHub Copilot CLI in a secure, sandboxed Docker environment.

## What's New in November 2025

1. **[Native ARM64 Support](#1-native-arm64-support-apple-silicon)** - fast, native performance on Mac and ARM devices
2. **[.NET 10 & PowerShell](#2-net-10-sdk--powershell-integration)** - Bleeding edge .NET and cross-platform scripting
3. **[Actual Path Mapping](#3-actual-path-mapping-know-where-you-are)** - Container paths match your host paths
4. **[Flexible Directory Mounts](#4-flexible-directory-mounts-access-what-you-need)** - Mount additional directories with granular control
5. **[Smart Window Titles](#5-smart-window-titles-cleaner-terminal-tabs)** - Auto-updating titles with mode indicators
6. **[Default Image Config](#6-default-image-configuration-variants--pinning)** - Lock your team to a specific image version
7. **[Auto-Update Checks](#7-auto-update-checks-stay-current)** - Get notified when new features land

## 1. Native ARM64 Support: Apple Silicon

This is the big one. Until now, Mac users on Apple Silicon were running the AMD64 image via Rosetta emulation. It worked, but it wasn't optimal.

As of version `2025-11-19`, we now publish multi-arch images for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### What this means for you:
- **Performance**: Native execution means faster startup and response times.
- **Efficiency**: Lower memory and CPU usage on Mac and ARM devices.
- **Compatibility**: You can now run `copilot_here` on other ARM Linux devices!

Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your architecture. No configuration needed.

## 2. .NET 10 SDK & PowerShell Integration

### .NET 10
For the .NET developers wanting the latest features, we now have specific image variants for each .NET version:

- `dotnet-8`: Previous LTS
- `dotnet-9`: Standard Term Support
- `dotnet-10`: Latest LTS

The main `dotnet` tag includes all three SDKs, but if you want a lighter image or specific version, you can now choose exactly what you need.

```bash
# Use the .NET 10 specific image
copilot_here --set-image dotnet-10
```

### PowerShell Core Everywhere
We've added PowerShell Core (`pwsh`) to the base image. This isn't just for Windows users—it means you can write and execute cross-platform automation scripts inside the container regardless of your host OS.

Combined with the new ARM64 support, you have a powerful, portable scripting environment that works identically on an x64 Windows PC and Apple Silicon.

## 3. Actual Path Mapping: Know Where You Are

### The Multi-Instance Confusion Problem

Picture this: You're investigating a bug with three terminal windows open:
- One in `/Users/me/projects/api`
- One in `/Users/me/projects/frontend`
- One in `/Users/me/investigations/bug-123`

Previously, `copilot_here` mapped all of these to `/work`. Inside the container, they all looked identical. Which project were you in? 🤔

### The Fix

The container now uses your **actual host path**.

**Before:**
```bash
# In /Users/me/projects/api
copilot_here
# Container sees: /work/src/...
```

**After:**
```bash
# In /Users/me/projects/api
copilot_here
# Container sees: /Users/me/projects/api/src/...
```

This simple change reduces mental overhead and makes copy-pasting paths between host and container seamless.

## 4. Flexible Directory Mounts: Access What You Need

Sometimes you need more than just the current directory. Maybe you need to reference architecture docs in `~/docs` or save logs to `~/investigations`.

We've introduced a three-tier mounting system:

### 1. CLI Flags (Quick & Temporary)
```bash
# Read-only mount (default)
copilot_here --mount ~/investigations

# Read-write mount
copilot_here --mount-rw ~/notes
```

### 2. Local Config (Project-Specific)
Save mounts for a specific project in `.copilot_here/mounts.conf`:
```bash
copilot_here --save-mount ~/investigations
```

### 3. Global Config (User-Wide)
Always have your notes available:
```bash
copilot_here --save-mount-global ~/common-notes
```

### Security First
Mounts default to **read-only**. You must explicitly request write access (`--mount-rw`), and the tool will warn you if you try to mount sensitive system paths (like `/` or `~/.ssh`).

## 5. Smart Window Titles: Cleaner Terminal Tabs

When running interactive CLI tools, your terminal tab usually just shows the raw command (e.g., `docker run ...`). This isn't helpful when you have multiple tabs open.

We've added **Smart Window Titles** that automatically update your terminal tab while Copilot is running:

- **Safe Mode**: `🤖 directory-name`
- **YOLO Mode**: `🤖⚡️ directory-name`

This makes it instantly obvious which tab is running Copilot and which mode it's in, without cluttering your view with long Docker commands. The title automatically reverts when you exit.

---

## 6. Default Image Configuration: Variants & Pinning

By default, `copilot_here` uses the `latest` tag. But you might want to use a specialized variant (like `dotnet` or `dotnet-playwright`) or pin a specific version for team consistency.

You can now configure a default image tag globally or per-project:

```bash
# List all available image variants
copilot_here --list-images

# Use the .NET variant for this project
copilot_here --set-image dotnet

# Pin to a specific SHA (recommended for strict team consistency)
copilot_here --set-image sha256:e73a13e...

# Clear configuration to revert to default
copilot_here --clear-image
```

Check your current configuration:
```bash
copilot_here --show-image
# Output:
# 🖼️  Current image: sha256:e73a13e... (from local config)
```

## 7. Auto-Update Checks: Stay Current

With the pace of updates (like this one!), it's easy to fall behind. The scripts now include a non-intrusive pre-run check.

If a new version is available, you'll see a subtle notification:
```text
📦 Update available: 2025-11-20.3 → 2025-11-20.15
Run 'copilot_here --update-scripts' to upgrade
```

It won't block your work, but it keeps you in the loop.

## Version Information

These changes are available in version **2025-11-20.15** and later.

```bash
# Bash/Zsh

## Try It Out

Installation is just three commands:

```bash
