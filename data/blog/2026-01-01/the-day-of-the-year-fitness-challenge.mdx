summary: 'Starting a new year usually comes with big fitness goals that fizzle out by February. I''m trying something different this year—a challenge that scales with me, starting with just 1 second of effort.'

I was thinking about how to kick off the year with a bit more consistency in my fitness. I'm definitely not at peak fitness right now, so I wanted something that scales. I hit on this idea: **The Day of the Year Challenge.** The logic is simple—whatever the day of the year is, that's your number. Today is January 1st, so the number is 1. By December 31st, the number is 365. 

How old were you when you realized you don't need a 2-hour gym session to start building a habit? 😅 Or maybe you've read *Atomic Habits* and know this already—it's all about those small wins.

## The Original Plan: Pushups ❌

Initially, I was going to do pushups. I figured starting at 1 and ending at 365 would be an epic way to build strength. But then I started doing the "architect math" on it:

* **Overuse Risk:** Doing 300+ pushups every single day by December is a massive load on the shoulders and elbows.
* **Fitness Gap:** Since I'm starting from a low baseline, jumping into high-volume daily pushups is a recipe for an injury that would side-line me by March.
* **Recovery:** Muscles need rest, and pushups are quite taxing on the central nervous system when you do them every single day without a break.

## The Pivot: Skipping and Sit-ups ✅

I decided to pivot to **skipping**. It's incredible cardio, but doing 1 "skip" felt a bit useless. So, for me, the number represents **seconds**. 

* **Today:** 1 second of skipping.
* **Dec 31st:** 365 seconds (just over 6 minutes).

I mentioned this to my wife, [Tiani](https://tianibeeming.com), and she thought it sounded like a cool idea, but she decided to join in a bit differently. She's not a fan of the rope, so she's going to do **sit-ups**, and for her, the number is the actual **count**. 

* **Today:** 1 sit-up.
* **Dec 31st:** 365 sit-ups.

## How it's going to work

To keep us honest and ensure we don't just "go through the motions," we've added a little bit of a "punishment" or tax for stopping. Think of it as a retry policy for a failing API—you can't just let the request drop!

### The Rules

* ✅ **Gordon (Skipping):** If I trip on the rope or stop before my time is up, I have to add a **10-second penalty** to the total for that day. 
* ✅ **Tiani (Sit-ups):** If she pauses or breaks her set, she has to add **5 extra reps** to her total.
* ⚠️ **The Streak:** If we miss a day, we have to "back-fill" the missed day's numbers on top of the current day. No technical debt allowed!

It feels like a sustainable way to build a habit without breaking ourselves in the first month. 

Stay tuned for updates as the numbers start to get real!
