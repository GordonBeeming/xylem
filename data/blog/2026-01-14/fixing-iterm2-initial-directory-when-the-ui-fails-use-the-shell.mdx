summary: 'Setting your initial directory in iTerm2 should be simple. But sometimes, despite your best efforts in the settings UI, you keep landing in the root directory. Here is the "brute force" fix to get you back into your workspace.'

Do you know those moments where you set a preference in an app, click save, and the app just... ignores you? 🙄

I recently ran into this with iTerm2 on my MacBook. I wanted every new terminal session to start in my GitHub folder, like I used with Warp. But no matter what I did in the profile settings, I kept landing at `/`. 

I even tried giving iTerm2 "Full Disk Access" in macOS to see if that worked... it didn't. 😤

## The Problem

In iTerm2, you should be able to go to your Profile settings and simply define your "Initial Directory." It looks correct and the path is valid, but when you hit `Cmd + T` for a new tab, you are greeted by this:

  alt="iTerm2 prompt showing the current directory as the root slash" 
  width="0" 
  height="0" 
  caption="Welcome to / ... not exactly where I wanted to be. 🙃" 
/>

Not exactly the productivity boost I was looking for... but `opencode` works better in iTerm than Warp... so I need to make it work! 😅

## The "Hack" Solution

After checking for hidden `cd` commands in my `.zshrc` and toggling every "Advanced Configuration" option known to man, I went for the brute force approach. 🛠️

If iTerm2 won't *start* in the right directory using the standard UI toggle, we'll just tell it to *move* there the split second it opens. 

### The Fix

1. Open iTerm2 **Settings** (`Cmd + ,`).
2. Go to **Profiles** > **General**.
3. Locate the **Send text at start** field.
4. Enter the following:

```zsh
cd /Users/gordonbeeming/Developer/github && clear

```

/>

## Why this works

By using **Send text at start**, iTerm2 waits for the shell to initialize and then "types" that command for you. ⌨️

✅ It bypasses the buggy initial directory logic.
✅ The `&& clear` part ensures your terminal stays clean so you don't even see the "hack" happening. ✨
✅ It respects your login environment (paths, aliases, etc.) because it runs *after* the shell is ready.

Is it a bit of a hack? **Yes.** Does it save me 5 seconds and a bit of sanity every time I open a terminal? **Absolutely.** ✅

Happy coding! 👨‍💻
