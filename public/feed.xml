    <description>Long ago, one of the ways we&#39;d get some reuse out of standard and utility files would be by exporting item templates. Since the .NET CLI rolled around, the approach has been different and much easier. </description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2022-08-24/scanning-infrastructure-as-code-iac-for-vulnerabilities</link>
    <description>In the modern world where it feels like every sentence has a Dev⭐Ops word in it, 1 that is probably used more than most is DevSecOps.When teams focus on DevSecOps they make sure to integrate security into every phase of development, this includes scanning for vulnerabilities as soon as possible. This videos shows you briefly how you can use Snyk to scan your terraform templates for vulnerabilities from your CLI as well as part of every commit pushed to GitHub.</description>

    <description>In this video we&#39;ll take a look at Managing GitHub secrets using terraform as well as federated identities from GitHub into Azure. You should only be storing secrets if you absolutely need to, in this demo although we are only accessing storage accounts the change from a storage connection string to Azure Federated Identity means that we can access any of resource the identity has access too using RBAC which is a much better overall approach.</description>

    <description>Whenever you take out an Azure VM you generally get a single disk which is not that big, when you select a SQL Server based VM (even web edition) you automatically get a 1TB disk, if you are using managed disks you pay for that whole TB even if you are only using 1GB of it. This post will show you how you can lower the price of that virtual machine if you are in this situation</description>

    <description>Recently talking to people it&#39;s obvious that a lot of people are either not following what is going on globally and in lots of cases have information that seems to have been obtained from unreliable sources MyBroadband released a post titled &quot;New rules for all co.za websites and ISPs during coronavirus outbreak&quot; which mentioned that ISPs needed a visible link to one of the South African information sites for corona virus so thought it would be a useful thing for more people to add banners in general to their sites linking to a trusted source for corona virus information</description>

    <description>Every time I create a new project using Azure Web Apps or even IIS and I need to add a pfx file for end to end https, Cloudflare gives you a private key and certificate but you can&#39;t use those directly with Azure Web Apps and I keep forgetting how to do this exactly so as I do sometimes I&#39;m going to post the steps so that it&#39;s helpful to others as well as future me.</description>

    <description>Have a site sitting in GitHub that you currently maybe manually deploy to Azure or use some other tool? Why not useGitHub Actionsto quickly and easily publish to Azure. I was pushing a small site (Guid.Empty) to Azure through GitHub and decided to document the couple steps for future me 😋... oh and for you of course 😅</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2020-03-18/the-importance-of-regression-testing-and-real-world-security-consequences</link>
    <description>Organizations often put a lot of effort around testing their products, they&#39;ll put tons of effort in unit testing, integration testing across their UI and API layers but sometimes have a strategy of covering everything. This doesn&#39;t always add value to their pipelines because the metric that is being chased is not value which agreeably is a hard thing to measure but rather it&#39;s a coverage metric. To start with I don&#39;t know if testing strategy is what was happening for TicTocTrack but is something that is definitely highlighted as something that would have been valuable for them. A security vulnerability discovered around a year ago from a fellow MVP and security expert Troy Hunt was patched and then earlier this year I re-discovered it</description>

    <description>If you don&#39;t know yet what GitHub actions are you can read about it on the GitHub Actions feature on GitHub. In short on the 8th of August GitHub announced an update to their actions which you can read about in this blog post. it&#39;s a very easy way to automate anything from any event in GitHub.</description>

    <description>So something that you&#39;ve probably noticed when using dev tools in the web and Visual Studio Code is that you can hit ctrl + enter and with this you may have noticed that in Visual Studio you can&#39;t do that. Below you&#39;ll see how you can add this to your IDE.</description>

    <description>I&#39;ve generally built libraries wrong by placing all binaries in the root and it&#39;s worked ok for now so why change it. I might also add that these libraries have been for internal use so no real reason for not doing this I guess.</description>

    <description>The post is going to go over the last 10 years (7 in more detail) and how I applied a little self control (eventually) and have sort of changed how I motivate myself to try better and why I came to do that. You can almost think of the journey as being a good movie where the dude in high school has everything, somehow loses it (well finding other great things) and then finds his way again (sort of).</description>

    <description>At MVP Summit this year one of the valuable things I learnt (which I can share ) was from Colin Dembovsky (ALM MVP) which was Using Chrome to Solve Identity Hell. Now I knew chrome profiles existed but never thought of using them to solve the problem of different identities, in-private mode was a way of doing things but you always lost that when closing the session so wasn&#39;t that great. Not going to talk much about that here, you can read his post to find out more.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-03-10/setting-wild-card-branch-policies-in-vsts</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve probably mentioned it before but keeping up with what&#39;s happening with VSTS is incredible hard with their 3 week cadence and generally huge set of features each 3 weeks. This week at MVP Summit I had what I thought would be a cool request to allow wild card branch policies. I was thinking of writing a console app to do this but thought it would be interesting to ask the product group as it&#39;s part of the many benefits of being a MVP .</description>

    <description>Today I played with a new .net core template just to see what the authentication options were out the box and was surprised to see just how easy it is to go from nothing to having a base project that has authentication fully baked in with 2 factor authentication and email verification.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-01-26/creating-an-asynchronous-authorizeattribute-in-mvc</link>
    <description>A couple days ago I needed to call a remote web api call in my AuthorizeAttribute sometimes but as mentioned in this (Is it possible to use async/await in MVC 4 AuthorizeAttribute?) StackOverflow question (and other forums) it isn&#39;t supported but is in the newer .net core. Unfortunately the project I needed this on was traditional MVC so I was left still finding a way .</description>

The steps below will work for moving between Resource Groups as well, you&#39;ll just skip some steps that would be obvious.</description>

    <description>With the rate that the VSTS team releases with all the features they releasing it&#39;s hard to know everything that exists in VSTS.

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-05-22/converting-html-to-pdf-using-c-and-magic</link>
    <description>Everyone at some point needs to convert and html page into a PDF for some reason or another. For this I&#39;ve always used a component which was cheap at the time (and is far from it now). This component has worked well for the last 8(ish) years, most ish in the last while because it doesn&#39;t deal well with https sites. When contacting the vendor they said hey but our latest version which can be expected I guess because it&#39;s 8 years down the line but then came the it&#39;s ALL OF THE $ . The last issue is that the component I used doesn&#39;t work in Azure. That lead me to some investigation and then ultimately this post.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-05-18/using-ngrok-to-test-web-apps-on-mobile-while-developing</link>
    <description>I often never really test on mobile properly because most sites are responsive so it&#39;s easier to just resize your browser and test like that. This works great until you trying to get the perfect mobile experience and looking at every element like how drop lists present themselves with different content taking into account how wrapping might happen in mobile browser controls (which is different from web browser, even in chrome ). A long time ago I briefly used ngrok just to test how it works and now I use it constantly for testing apps while they are still in development.</description>

    <description>If you do a quick Google for pros of setting up continuous integration you&#39;ll come across a lot of articles about how good setting up continuous integration (CI) is compared to googling cons of setting up continuous integration which basically gives you the same posts of the the pros search so we won&#39;t dig too much into that now .</description>

    <description>You might be wondering after recently posting Setting up a standard continuous integration build with VSTS/TFS why I&#39;d need to post specifically on .net core. After all it&#39;s still a Visual Studio solution so things should just work, the keyword here is should . Things didn&#39;t just work when I tried to get this working so decided to share my experience here (as well as document it for myself later ).</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-04-12/implementing-a-dynamic-robotstxt</link>
    <description>Firstly you might want to know why would you want to implement a dynamic robots.txt? Isn&#39;t it better to just put a static file in the web app? Yes it is but when you running your application on certain platforms like web apps in Azure when you using deployment slots. I found this handy link which explains deployment slots quite nicely , but basically what happens is when you switch 2 slots Azure will do a virtual IP switch so traffic from your slots will now be switched (not the files from each slot).</description>

    <description>If you&#39;ve done any amount of development where you need to interact with data you&#39;d know that at some point customers or stakeholders always want to know who made that change or when was that change made. To answer these questions you&#39;d look to your auditing which in most cases is the last thing people think about adding into their apps for some reason.</description>

    <description>I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not just me but one of the things I was missing from SSMS 2014 is that I had my line breaks when copying large text fields out of the query results. For a long time I have been putting it off and only using SSMS 2014, last week I re-installed my Operating System and decided not to install SSMS 2014 just for this 1 feature.</description>

    <description>A couple weeks ago I was asked to present at DUT to a group of students.

So I decided that I&#39;d record all the content and post it up so that others can potentially benefit from it as well.</description>

    <description>Today I decided to record a presentation I did recently. It will be posted soon but in the meantime here&#39;s something else. While I was busy recording my wife (Tiani) decided that her and the kids would make a cake. It was as usual one of the best cakes I&#39;ve tasted. If you haven&#39;t seen any of her other creations take a look at her Facebook page3 Tiers Novalty Cakes, below is my cake for my 25th birthday cake.</description>

    <title>VSTS widget for GitHub badges</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-01-28/vsts-widget-for-github-badges</link>
    <description>When I first heard about the SDK for widgets in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) I wanted to make a couple of widgets, one of these was a GitHub widget that would show some info from any GitHub repo on your VSTS dashboard. This can can be helpful when you have your source open on GitHub but still work out of VSTS.</description>

    <description>So everyone wants to have the ultimate system that never breaks can handle &#39;all&#39; the users and shows no strain when doing so. How do you accomplish something like this? Well you could hire developers that know all the best ways to do everything, experts in everything related to configuring applications to run the best that they can on the hardware and software it sits on but what&#39;s the odds of that happening. The other option is to have a bank account that is never ending and throw &#39;all&#39; the hardware at your application to make sure it doesn&#39;t ever have a slow day but then how are you making your money, how do you know when &#39;all&#39; the hardware isn&#39;t enough.</description>

    <description>So if you haven&#39;t heard yet VSO Extensions are now in a private preview where you can sign up to get into the preview on extensions integration site. These extensions in the shortest sentence a supported way of doing customizations to VSO that will replace any of the &quot;hacky&quot; extensions that you may be playing around with at the moment like Tiago Pascal&#39;s Task Board Enhancer or maybe you have even created your own following similar steps to what I show in my TFS 2013 Customization book.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2015-04-09/they-said-select-was-bad-but</link>
    <description>So speaking to any smart database people they will generally tell you that the SELECT * FROM ... is a bad idea and should not be used. Today (well would of been if I didn&#39;t procrastinate) I spent many hours debugging something from the wrong places because I used SELECT *. Below is what I found out =). Rennie Moodley helped me understand what was happening after I figured out where the problem was, helped me create the sample code below and then the 2 of us and Christopher Swart poked at and improve the sample and found some more weirdness which you&#39;ll also see below.</description>

    <description>I had some &quot;Weird&quot; things happening with IIS on one of my developer machines. After trouble shooting for a while I decided that was definitely not winning and removed all features from my pc that were even the slightest related to IIS, my pc required a restart so I did. When it came back I re-enabled all the features as I would normally do and then attempted to put my dev site in IIS. For some reason all the sites were stopped and when trying to start them I received the message</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-12-10/application-insights-for-windows-store-apps-in-azure-portal</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve been using Application Insights for a while now you would have noticed that with recent Visual Updates the Application Insights SDK had been updated to use a new version that logs AI data into the new Azure Portal. From this if you use Windows Store Apps you would probably have noticed that if you instrument a Windows Store application with the new SDK that you can&#39;t actually find your data anywhere although you can see it being logged from the Visual Studio Output window and using Fiddler. The good news is that you will soon be able to have a great experience with the new AI SDK for Windows Store apps as you do for your currently for your web applications, the better news is that below you&#39;ll see how to use the new SDK for your Store Apps and see the data in the Azure Portal.</description>

    <description>I used to highlight a bunch of text (a couple of statements) then press F5 to execute that statement. With this new release you are able to easily execute the current statement by pressing Shift + F5.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-09-12/upgradepublish-tfs-2013-process-templates-with-powershell</link>
    <description>I use to make a lot of TFS customizations and had to apply the template changes to multiple team projects which took a bit of time. Depending on the method you use it could be a quick or loooong process . When I first started doing customizations I used the TFS Power Tools to upload changes which is a lot of effort because you are uploading one work item definition at a time into one team project.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-07-16/organize-your-music-collection</link>
    <description>I was looking for a PowerShell script that would remove all media tags (post coming) from a folder of music that I have and along the way I came across a blog post called PowerShell - Automatically organizing your mp3-collection. Although this wasn&#39;t exactly what I was looking for right now I gave it a try and then thought to share it after I made a couple of changes to make it work on my machine and categorize a bit more . You can grab the script off GitHub Gist organise-music.ps1.</description>

    <description>Up until about an hour ago I thought I knew how optional parameters worked but didn&#39;t actually. I thought (probably without giving it too much thought) that optional parameters would compile to something that would reflect having multiple overloads as when they came out I ripped out 100s of overloads across multiple libraries and replaces them with optional parameters because it replace code like</description>

    <description>I watch and download a lot of videos from Channel 9 and because I&#39;m a developer and always looking for ways to speed up anything I do I searched for a PowerShell script. I eventually found one (can&#39;t remember where) and immediately set it up to download This Week on Channel 9 and Ping Show. Over time I have added many other shows, events and series. The initial script I was found with some modifications was</description>

    <description>Visual Studio 2013 Update 1 has been released and as usual you are able to use the /layout argument to download all the files so you can share them locally instead of everyone downloading them. As mentioned in Brian Harry&#39;s blog here there is no update for TFS this time round but good things are coming for TFS Update 2.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-01-10/how-to-enforce-check-in-policies</link>
    <description>So one of the benefits of using Server side Plugins is that you can&#39;t override them. The problem with this is that the users don&#39;t know that the policy is in place until they check-in their code. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if me as a user were told this is what I need to do as in see the requirements from check-in policies but then to make the administrators or business rules that require the policies to also be happy.</description>

    <description>Today I find myself with yet another bit of functionality that only works when you are running in Administrator Mode. A while back I had Full Admin Mode always enabled, downside of this is the store apps don&#39;t work at all. Up side is your PC works as expected . I created a PowerShell script to download Channel 9 videos as described in my post Easily download Ch9 videos, this script worked perfectly but recently started breaking with the error</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-16/add-work-item-links-from-check-in-comments</link>
    <description>The other night while watching the Visual Studio 2013 Launch a question came up asking if the team had added support yet for automatically linking work items to the change set created when checking in as it currently is in Git. Currently this functionality doesn&#39;t exist for TFVC Check ins, at the time I didn&#39;t think anything of it but tonight for some reason I thought &quot;hey that would be something simply to create and should hopefully make lives easier for developers&quot;. So I opened up Visual Studio and at the same time started a new project on GitHub for TFS Server Plugins. The code required for the plugin was very basic, basically just checked the comment from the check in with a regular expression and then added the links between the change set and all the IDs found in the comments.</description>

    <description>So this is my first post in my new blog which I should be using for quite a bit longer than I Currently have been using my previous blogs on WordPress. I am using a base that was started by Mads Kristensen on GitHub called MiniBlog. I am trying where possible or requested pushing some changes back into the project so that others can also get extra functionality.</description>
