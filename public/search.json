Currently this functionality doesn't exist for TFVC Check ins, at the time I didn't think anything of it but tonight for some reason I thought \"hey that would be something simply to create and should hopefully make lives easier for developers\". So I opened up Visual Studio and at the same time started a new project on GitHub for TFS Server Plugins. The code required for the plugin was very basic, basically just checked the comment from the check in with a regular expression and then added the links between the change set and all the IDs found in the comments.","image":"/static/images/twitter-card.png","url":"https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-16/add-work-item-links-from-check-in-comments"}},{"title":"TypeScript : Emit Error: Write to file failed..","date":"2013-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["VSTS / TFS","Visual Studio","TFS","TypeScript","TFS Build"],"draft":false,"summary":"I have been playing around with TypeScript for a while and usually I just publish from my machine but today I decided to setup a CI build for the solution and found that I received the error","type":"Blog","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read","minutes":0.81,"time":48600,"words":162},"slug":"2013-11-15/typescript-emit-error-write-to-file-failed","path":"blog/2013-11-15/typescript-emit-error-write-to-file-failed","filePath":"blog/2013-11-15/typescript-emit-error-write-to-file-failed.mdx","toc":[],"structuredData":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"TypeScript : Emit Error: Write to file failed..","datePublished":"2013-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2013-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I have been playing around with TypeScript for a while and usually I just publish from my machine but today I decided to setup a CI build for the solution and found that I received the error","image":"/static/images/twitter-card.png","url":"https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-15/typescript-emit-error-write-to-file-failed"}},{"title":"Visual Studio 2012 – Paste Special Feature","date":"2013-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Visual Studio","XML","JSON","Visual Studio 2013"],"draft":false,"summary":"Generally the longest and most frustrating part of using a 3rd party API is making all the C# classes that the data will plugin to after you make requests into those API's.","type":"Blog","readingTime":{"text":"4 min read","minutes":3.08,"time":184800,"words":616},"slug":"2013-10-29/visual-studio-2012-paste-special-feature","path":"blog/2013-10-29/visual-studio-2012-paste-special-feature","filePath":"blog/2013-10-29/visual-studio-2012-paste-special-feature.mdx","toc":[{"value":"","url":"#","depth":2},{"value":"Generating classes","url":"#generating-classes","depth":2},{"value":"Loading generated JSON objects","url":"#loading-generated-json-objects","depth":2},{"value":"Enjoy","url":"#enjoy","depth":2}],"structuredData":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Visual Studio 2012 – Paste Special Feature","datePublished":"2013-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2013-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Generally the longest and most frustrating part of using a 3rd party API is making all the C# classes that the data will plugin to after you make requests into those API's.","image":"/static/images/twitter-card.png","url":"https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-10-29/visual-studio-2012-paste-special-feature"}},{"title":"First post here","date":"2013-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Chatter","GitHub Projects"],"draft":false,"summary":"So this is my first post in my new blog which I should be using for quite a bit longer than I Currently have been using my previous blogs on WordPress.
