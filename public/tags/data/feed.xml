    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2015-01-07/failover-or-restart-results-in-reseed-of-identity-fix</link>
    <description>This post has been ported from http://www.sqlservercentral.com/scripts/MS+SQL+2012/93043/ which I then repeated on https://gbeeming.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/failover-or-restart-results-in-reseed-of-identity-fix/.</description>

    <description>So speaking to any smart database people they will generally tell you that the SELECT * FROM ... is a bad idea and should not be used. Today (well would of been if I didn&#39;t procrastinate) I spent many hours debugging something from the wrong places because I used SELECT *. Below is what I found out =). Rennie Moodley helped me understand what was happening after I figured out where the problem was, helped me create the sample code below and then the 2 of us and Christopher Swart poked at and improve the sample and found some more weirdness which you&#39;ll also see below.</description>

    <title>SSMS 2016 where have my line breaks gone?</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-07-25/ssms-2016-where-have-my-line-breaks-gone</link>
    <description>I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not just me but one of the things I was missing from SSMS 2014 is that I had my line breaks when copying large text fields out of the query results. For a long time I have been putting it off and only using SSMS 2014, last week I re-installed my Operating System and decided not to install SSMS 2014 just for this 1 feature.</description>

    <title>Easily adding auditing to a Entity Framework Code First project</title>

    <description>If you&#39;ve done any amount of development where you need to interact with data you&#39;d know that at some point customers or stakeholders always want to know who made that change or when was that change made. To answer these questions you&#39;d look to your auditing which in most cases is the last thing people think about adding into their apps for some reason.</description>
