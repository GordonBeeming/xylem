    <title>Converting Html to Pdf using C# and magic!</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-05-22/converting-html-to-pdf-using-c-and-magic</link>
    <description>Everyone at some point needs to convert and html page into a PDF for some reason or another. For this I&#39;ve always used a component which was cheap at the time (and is far from it now). This component has worked well for the last 8(ish) years, most ish in the last while because it doesn&#39;t deal well with https sites. When contacting the vendor they said hey but our latest version which can be expected I guess because it&#39;s 8 years down the line but then came the it&#39;s ALL OF THE $ . The last issue is that the component I used doesn&#39;t work in Azure. That lead me to some investigation and then ultimately this post.</description>
