    <description>Today I find myself with yet another bit of functionality that only works when you are running in Administrator Mode. A while back I had Full Admin Mode always enabled, downside of this is the store apps don&#39;t work at all. Up side is your PC works as expected . I created a PowerShell script to download Channel 9 videos as described in my post Easily download Ch9 videos, this script worked perfectly but recently started breaking with the error</description>

    <description>So I&#39;m starting to go through some of the content on Microsoft Virtual Academy but I don&#39;t have time to do this when I&#39;m by a good internet connection and at the same time don&#39;t have time when by the good internet connection to run though all the content I need to download it to watch in my spare time.</description>

    <title>Easily download Ch9 videos</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-04-10/easily-download-ch9-videos</link>
    <description>I watch and download a lot of videos from Channel 9 and because I&#39;m a developer and always looking for ways to speed up anything I do I searched for a PowerShell script. I eventually found one (can&#39;t remember where) and immediately set it up to download This Week on Channel 9 and Ping Show. Over time I have added many other shows, events and series. The initial script I was found with some modifications was</description>

    <title>Organize your Music Collection</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-07-16/organize-your-music-collection</link>
    <description>I was looking for a PowerShell script that would remove all media tags (post coming) from a folder of music that I have and along the way I came across a blog post called PowerShell - Automatically organizing your mp3-collection. Although this wasn&#39;t exactly what I was looking for right now I gave it a try and then thought to share it after I made a couple of changes to make it work on my machine and categorize a bit more . You can grab the script off GitHub Gist organise-music.ps1.</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-09-12/upgradepublish-tfs-2013-process-templates-with-powershell</link>
    <description>I use to make a lot of TFS customizations and had to apply the template changes to multiple team projects which took a bit of time. Depending on the method you use it could be a quick or loooong process . When I first started doing customizations I used the TFS Power Tools to upload changes which is a lot of effort because you are uploading one work item definition at a time into one team project.</description>

    <description>Today my DotNet Pretty articles were featured on @coding4fun by Greg Duncan and one of the comments by Niner bc3tech (@bc3tech) requested that I share this solution on Chocolatey. I decided that this was a good idea and decided to share my experience .</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-01-03/moving-application-insights-resources-between-subscriptions-in-azure</link>
    <description>There is documentation available for Move resources to new resource group or subscription but things are easier to do with exact sample code so here it goes . The steps below will work for moving between Resource Groups as well, you&#39;ll just skip some steps that would be obvious.</description>
