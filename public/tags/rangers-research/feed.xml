    <title>Upgrade/Publish TFS 2013 Process Templates with PowerShell</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-09-12/upgradepublish-tfs-2013-process-templates-with-powershell</link>
    <description>I use to make a lot of TFS customizations and had to apply the template changes to multiple team projects which took a bit of time. Depending on the method you use it could be a quick or loooong process . When I first started doing customizations I used the TFS Power Tools to upload changes which is a lot of effort because you are uploading one work item definition at a time into one team project.</description>

    <title>Application Insights for Windows Store Apps in Azure Portal</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-12-10/application-insights-for-windows-store-apps-in-azure-portal</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve been using Application Insights for a while now you would have noticed that with recent Visual Updates the Application Insights SDK had been updated to use a new version that logs AI data into the new Azure Portal. From this if you use Windows Store Apps you would probably have noticed that if you instrument a Windows Store application with the new SDK that you can&#39;t actually find your data anywhere although you can see it being logged from the Visual Studio Output window and using Fiddler. The good news is that you will soon be able to have a great experience with the new AI SDK for Windows Store apps as you do for your currently for your web applications, the better news is that below you&#39;ll see how to use the new SDK for your Store Apps and see the data in the Azure Portal.</description>
