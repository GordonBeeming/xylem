    <description>So speaking to any smart database people they will generally tell you that the SELECT * FROM ... is a bad idea and should not be used. Today (well would of been if I didn&#39;t procrastinate) I spent many hours debugging something from the wrong places because I used SELECT *. Below is what I found out =). Rennie Moodley helped me understand what was happening after I figured out where the problem was, helped me create the sample code below and then the 2 of us and Christopher Swart poked at and improve the sample and found some more weirdness which you&#39;ll also see below.</description>
