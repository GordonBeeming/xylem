    <title>Add work item links from check in comments</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-16/add-work-item-links-from-check-in-comments</link>
    <description>The other night while watching the Visual Studio 2013 Launch a question came up asking if the team had added support yet for automatically linking work items to the change set created when checking in as it currently is in Git. Currently this functionality doesn&#39;t exist for TFVC Check ins, at the time I didn&#39;t think anything of it but tonight for some reason I thought &quot;hey that would be something simply to create and should hopefully make lives easier for developers&quot;. So I opened up Visual Studio and at the same time started a new project on GitHub for TFS Server Plugins. The code required for the plugin was very basic, basically just checked the comment from the check in with a regular expression and then added the links between the change set and all the IDs found in the comments.</description>
