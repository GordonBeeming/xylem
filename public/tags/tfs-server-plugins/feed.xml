    <title>Add work item links from check in comments</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-16/add-work-item-links-from-check-in-comments</link>
    <description>The other night while watching the Visual Studio 2013 Launch a question came up asking if the team had added support yet for automatically linking work items to the change set created when checking in as it currently is in Git. Currently this functionality doesn&#39;t exist for TFVC Check ins, at the time I didn&#39;t think anything of it but tonight for some reason I thought &quot;hey that would be something simply to create and should hopefully make lives easier for developers&quot;. So I opened up Visual Studio and at the same time started a new project on GitHub for TFS Server Plugins. The code required for the plugin was very basic, basically just checked the comment from the check in with a regular expression and then added the links between the change set and all the IDs found in the comments.</description>

    <title>How to Enforce Check-In Policies</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-01-10/how-to-enforce-check-in-policies</link>
    <description>So one of the benefits of using Server side Plugins is that you can&#39;t override them. The problem with this is that the users don&#39;t know that the policy is in place until they check-in their code. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if me as a user were told this is what I need to do as in see the requirements from check-in policies but then to make the administrators or business rules that require the policies to also be happy.</description>
