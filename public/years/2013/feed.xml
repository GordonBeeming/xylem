    <title>First post here</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-10-22/first-post-here</link>
    <description>So this is my first post in my new blog which I should be using for quite a bit longer than I Currently have been using my previous blogs on WordPress. I am using a base that was started by Mads Kristensen on GitHub called MiniBlog. I am trying where possible or requested pushing some changes back into the project so that others can also get extra functionality.</description>

    <description>Generally the longest and most frustrating part of using a 3rd party API is making all the C# classes that the data will plugin to after you make requests into those API&#39;s.</description>

    <title>Add work item links from check in comments</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2013-11-16/add-work-item-links-from-check-in-comments</link>
    <description>The other night while watching the Visual Studio 2013 Launch a question came up asking if the team had added support yet for automatically linking work items to the change set created when checking in as it currently is in Git. Currently this functionality doesn&#39;t exist for TFVC Check ins, at the time I didn&#39;t think anything of it but tonight for some reason I thought &quot;hey that would be something simply to create and should hopefully make lives easier for developers&quot;. So I opened up Visual Studio and at the same time started a new project on GitHub for TFS Server Plugins. The code required for the plugin was very basic, basically just checked the comment from the check in with a regular expression and then added the links between the change set and all the IDs found in the comments.</description>
