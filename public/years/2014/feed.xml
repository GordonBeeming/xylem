    <description>Today I find myself with yet another bit of functionality that only works when you are running in Administrator Mode. A while back I had Full Admin Mode always enabled, downside of this is the store apps don&#39;t work at all. Up side is your PC works as expected . I created a PowerShell script to download Channel 9 videos as described in my post Easily download Ch9 videos, this script worked perfectly but recently started breaking with the error</description>

    <title>How to Enforce Check-In Policies</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-01-10/how-to-enforce-check-in-policies</link>
    <description>So one of the benefits of using Server side Plugins is that you can&#39;t override them. The problem with this is that the users don&#39;t know that the policy is in place until they check-in their code. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if me as a user were told this is what I need to do as in see the requirements from check-in policies but then to make the administrators or business rules that require the policies to also be happy.</description>

    <description>So we use CheckPoint VPN, but the most frustrating part is that when a new version on windows is released the CheckPoint VPN client is incompatible with it and makes your computer weird when you do try use it.</description>

    <description>In these posts we will be going through creating different elements that can be found in the Team Explorer, the aim is to give you the ground knowledge required to extend Team Explorer your way. For an example of some great Team Explorer plugins that demonstrate how much you can do take a look at Team Rooms for Visual Studio 2013 and News which were created by Utkarsh Shigihalli and Tarun Arora for Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2013.</description>

    <description>Visual Studio 2013 Update 1 has been released and as usual you are able to use the /layout argument to download all the files so you can share them locally instead of everyone downloading them. As mentioned in Brian Harry&#39;s blog here there is no update for TFS this time round but good things are coming for TFS Update 2.</description>

I eventually found one (can&#39;t remember where) and immediately set it up to download This Week on Channel 9 and Ping Show. Over time I have added many other shows, events and series. The initial script I was found with some modifications was</description>

    <description>Up until about an hour ago I thought I knew how optional parameters worked but didn&#39;t actually. I thought (probably without giving it too much thought) that optional parameters would compile to something that would reflect having multiple overloads as when they came out I ripped out 100s of overloads across multiple libraries and replaces them with optional parameters because it replace code like</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-07-16/organize-your-music-collection</link>
    <description>I was looking for a PowerShell script that would remove all media tags (post coming) from a folder of music that I have and along the way I came across a blog post called PowerShell - Automatically organizing your mp3-collection. Although this wasn&#39;t exactly what I was looking for right now I gave it a try and then thought to share it after I made a couple of changes to make it work on my machine and categorize a bit more . You can grab the script off GitHub Gist organise-music.ps1.</description>

    <description>I use to make a lot of TFS customizations and had to apply the template changes to multiple team projects which took a bit of time. Depending on the method you use it could be a quick or loooong process .

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2014-12-10/application-insights-for-windows-store-apps-in-azure-portal</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve been using Application Insights for a while now you would have noticed that with recent Visual Updates the Application Insights SDK had been updated to use a new version that logs AI data into the new Azure Portal. From this if you use Windows Store Apps you would probably have noticed that if you instrument a Windows Store application with the new SDK that you can&#39;t actually find your data anywhere although you can see it being logged from the Visual Studio Output window and using Fiddler. The good news is that you will soon be able to have a great experience with the new AI SDK for Windows Store apps as you do for your currently for your web applications, the better news is that below you&#39;ll see how to use the new SDK for your Store Apps and see the data in the Azure Portal.</description>
