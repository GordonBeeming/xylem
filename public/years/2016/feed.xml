    <title>VSTS widget for GitHub badges</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-01-28/vsts-widget-for-github-badges</link>
    <description>When I first heard about the SDK for widgets in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) I wanted to make a couple of widgets, one of these was a GitHub widget that would show some info from any GitHub repo on your VSTS dashboard. This can can be helpful when you have your source open on GitHub but still work out of VSTS.</description>

    <title>Making a Cake Day</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-05-02/making-a-cake-day</link>
    <description>Today I decided to record a presentation I did recently. It will be posted soon but in the meantime here&#39;s something else. While I was busy recording my wife (Tiani) decided that her and the kids would make a cake. It was as usual one of the best cakes I&#39;ve tasted. If you haven&#39;t seen any of her other creations take a look at her Facebook page3 Tiers Novalty Cakes, below is my cake for my 25th birthday cake.</description>

    <title>Visual Studio Team Services Overview - Video Series</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-05-03/visual-studio-team-services-overview-video-series</link>
    <description>A couple weeks ago I was asked to present at DUT to a group of students. The presentation was quite a long one so I had to cut some bits out in order to present in the timeslot that I had. So I decided that I&#39;d record all the content and post it up so that others can potentially benefit from it as well.</description>

    <title>SSMS 2016 where have my line breaks gone?</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2016-07-25/ssms-2016-where-have-my-line-breaks-gone</link>
    <description>I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not just me but one of the things I was missing from SSMS 2014 is that I had my line breaks when copying large text fields out of the query results. For a long time I have been putting it off and only using SSMS 2014, last week I re-installed my Operating System and decided not to install SSMS 2014 just for this 1 feature.</description>
