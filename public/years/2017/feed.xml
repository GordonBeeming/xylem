    <description>If you&#39;ve done any amount of development where you need to interact with data you&#39;d know that at some point customers or stakeholders always want to know who made that change or when was that change made. To answer these questions you&#39;d look to your auditing which in most cases is the last thing people think about adding into their apps for some reason.</description>

    <description>I&#39;m busy going through Pluralsight watching Exploring C# 6 with Jon Skeet by Rob Conery. Jon Skeet goes ahead and makes this epic method that looks like it&#39;s so naughty but is pretty cool.</description>

    <description>If you&#39;ve installed Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise and weren&#39;t one of the people that went over to the Individual Components tab to see what you weren&#39;t installing you probably don&#39;t have Microsoft Test Manager installed.</description>

    <title>Implementing a dynamic robots.txt</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-04-12/implementing-a-dynamic-robotstxt</link>
    <description>Firstly you might want to know why would you want to implement a dynamic robots.txt? Isn&#39;t it better to just put a static file in the web app? Yes it is but when you running your application on certain platforms like web apps in Azure when you using deployment slots. I found this handy link which explains deployment slots quite nicely , but basically what happens is when you switch 2 slots Azure will do a virtual IP switch so traffic from your slots will now be switched (not the files from each slot).</description>

    <description>If you do a quick Google for pros of setting up continuous integration you&#39;ll come across a lot of articles about how good setting up continuous integration (CI) is compared to googling cons of setting up continuous integration which basically gives you the same posts of the the pros search so we won&#39;t dig too much into that now .</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-04-23/setting-up-net-core-continuous-integration-build-with-vststfs</link>
    <description>You might be wondering after recently posting Setting up a standard continuous integration build with VSTS/TFS why I&#39;d need to post specifically on .net core. After all it&#39;s still a Visual Studio solution so things should just work, the keyword here is should . Things didn&#39;t just work when I tried to get this working so decided to share my experience here (as well as document it for myself later ).</description>

    <title>Using ngrok to test web apps on mobile while developing</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-05-18/using-ngrok-to-test-web-apps-on-mobile-while-developing</link>
    <description>I often never really test on mobile properly because most sites are responsive so it&#39;s easier to just resize your browser and test like that. This works great until you trying to get the perfect mobile experience and looking at every element like how drop lists present themselves with different content taking into account how wrapping might happen in mobile browser controls (which is different from web browser, even in chrome ). A long time ago I briefly used ngrok just to test how it works and now I use it constantly for testing apps while they are still in development.</description>

    <title>Converting Html to Pdf using C# and magic!</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-05-22/converting-html-to-pdf-using-c-and-magic</link>
    <description>Everyone at some point needs to convert and html page into a PDF for some reason or another. For this I&#39;ve always used a component which was cheap at the time (and is far from it now). This component has worked well for the last 8(ish) years, most ish in the last while because it doesn&#39;t deal well with https sites. When contacting the vendor they said hey but our latest version which can be expected I guess because it&#39;s 8 years down the line but then came the it&#39;s ALL OF THE $ . The last issue is that the component I used doesn&#39;t work in Azure. That lead me to some investigation and then ultimately this post.</description>

    <description>Today I tried to join one of my machines to the insider preview. Most people if they get issues would probably take it as a sign that putting the broken bits on their machine was a bad idea and the universe has saved them…I need my broken bits fix .</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2017-07-25/bulk-import-git-repositories-into-vststfs</link>
    <description>With the rate that the VSTS team releases with all the features they releasing it&#39;s hard to know everything that exists in VSTS. I recently needed to migrate git repos from various Team Project Collections (TPC) into a single Team Project and started out doing it very manually and slowly progresses to importing over 100 in a couple hours .</description>
