    <title>Moving Application Insights resources between subscriptions in Azure</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-01-03/moving-application-insights-resources-between-subscriptions-in-azure</link>
    <description>There is documentation available for Move resources to new resource group or subscription but things are easier to do with exact sample code so here it goes . The steps below will work for moving between Resource Groups as well, you&#39;ll just skip some steps that would be obvious.</description>

    <title>Creating an asynchronous AuthorizeAttribute in MVC</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-01-26/creating-an-asynchronous-authorizeattribute-in-mvc</link>
    <description>A couple days ago I needed to call a remote web api call in my AuthorizeAttribute sometimes but as mentioned in this (Is it possible to use async/await in MVC 4 AuthorizeAttribute?) StackOverflow question (and other forums) it isn&#39;t supported but is in the newer .net core. Unfortunately the project I needed this on was traditional MVC so I was left still finding a way .</description>

    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-02-15/setting-up-2-factor-authentication-and-email-verification-with-net-core-20</link>
    <description>Today I played with a new .net core template just to see what the authentication options were out the box and was surprised to see just how easy it is to go from nothing to having a base project that has authentication fully baked in with 2 factor authentication and email verification.</description>

    <title>Setting wild card branch policies in @VSTS</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-03-10/setting-wild-card-branch-policies-in-vsts</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve probably mentioned it before but keeping up with what&#39;s happening with VSTS is incredible hard with their 3 week cadence and generally huge set of features each 3 weeks. This week at MVP Summit I had what I thought would be a cool request to allow wild card branch policies. I was thinking of writing a console app to do this but thought it would be interesting to ask the product group as it&#39;s part of the many benefits of being a MVP .</description>

    <title>Set which chrome profile for Visual Studio to use</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-03-26/set-which-chrome-profile-for-visual-studio-to-use</link>
    <description>At MVP Summit this year one of the valuable things I learnt (which I can share ) was from Colin Dembovsky (ALM MVP) which was Using Chrome to Solve Identity Hell. Now I knew chrome profiles existed but never thought of using them to solve the problem of different identities, in-private mode was a way of doing things but you always lost that when closing the session so wasn&#39;t that great. Not going to talk much about that here, you can read his post to find out more.</description>

    <title>A journey worth taking</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-05-21/a-journey-worth-taking</link>
    <description>The post is going to go over the last 10 years (7 in more detail) and how I applied a little self control (eventually) and have sort of changed how I motivate myself to try better and why I came to do that. You can almost think of the journey as being a good movie where the dude in high school has everything, somehow loses it (well finding other great things) and then finds his way again (sort of).</description>

    <description>Although I&#39;m hoping everyone reading this doesn&#39;t need this I thought I&#39;d share anyway. A little under a month ago Jeremy Epling (@jeremy_epling) posted on the Microsoft DevOps Blog about the New Navigation for Visual Studio Team Services. I&#39;m not going to repeat the very detailed blog post but I am going to show you how to enabled the amazing experience quickly.</description>

    <title>Building libraries that target multiple frameworks</title>
    <link>https://gordonbeeming.com/blog/2018-07-30/building-libraries-that-target-multiple-frameworks</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve generally built libraries wrong by placing all binaries in the root and it&#39;s worked ok for now so why change it. I might also add that these libraries have been for internal use so no real reason for not doing this I guess.</description>

    <description>TYMHKON is something random that to me looks like it could be Japanese? Not sure what makes me think that when seeing it but what it really stands for is Things You May Have Known Or Not!</description>
